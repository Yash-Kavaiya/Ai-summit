## 📝 Transcript

along with us building on our models uh you know these things just unlock incredible amount of potential so I think just to wrap this up for sure you know we don't want intelligence to just

be in eval benchmarks we want to make sure that it delivers for all of us because that is when impact will start to happen and we're already seeing it but we want to do much more

&gt;&gt; Sabina uh you're the president uh and and executive director of just jobs network often we uh you know create solutions without understanding the problem. And my question to you is could

you uh for for for our own kind of education explain to us the sort of features of agriculture, energy, manufacturing these sectors which are going to be impacted both by climate

action as well as with AI. But first we need to understand the nature of that market nature of the labor market in these sectors. Could you help us understand that first? Then we can see

how the the skilling story responds accordingly. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Hello. &gt;&gt; You might have to just switch it on.

&gt;&gt; It has a green light. &gt;&gt; Got it. There we go. Not the most techn technologically savvy person clearly. Um but uh thank you Aronaba for for uh inviting me here today. Thanks to CEW

and and all of your colleagues for the great coordination. Um, so let me just start by telling you a story the way I see it, the way Just Jobs Network sees it. We're a research organization that

really focuses on actionoriented research, gathering data from the field to really understand how technology and climate change and the energy transition are affecting real people's lives,

right? Our lives, all of our lives. Um and so let me tell you the story of two Indas right there's one India that is characterized by high levels of GDP growth very low levels of unemployment

3.1% that's nothing anything below 5% is considered full employment gito there's no there's no uh real unemployment problem right we hear that um we're charact you know all of us are here

today fascinated by the buzz words of innovation and technology and entrepreneurship. How exciting all of that sounds. Um, but then on the other hand, there's another reality that is

also true. There's the reality of the phrase jobless growth. The fact that every unit of growth creates a very very small negligible number of of jobs. So just you can have growth but it doesn't

translate into jobs. I see a lot of young people in this room. There are 370 million young people between the ages of 15 to 29 in India. Okay, that is more people just between the ages of 15 to 29

in India than the entire uh population of any industrialized country, United States, pick any industrialized country. We have more people just in the 15 to 29 age group, young people, right?

And the unemployment rate for these young people is three times the the uh total unemployment rate. But that's not even the problem. The reason our our overall unemployment rate is only 3.1%

is because most people don't have the luxury of being unemployed. They have to work in order to survive, in order to, you know, make ends meet for their families. And so you know and then you

have this other backdrop where yes we do have innovation, we do have technology, we do have um entrepreneurship but there are not proper institutions to redistribute the gains from those to the

broader population. Right? So there's an accumulation of wealth. The rich are getting richer and there's a large part of our our population that is still struggling. Right? We don't have the

social protection systems in place to redistribute the wealth and we certainly don't have the education and skills systems to be able to train and retrain. We've been hearing about skills

development for a very like you know well over a decade now. Uh and yet if you look at the labor force survey only 4.1% of respondents actually identify as having any formal skills. Right? So I

can go on and on about the problems with the education and the skills training systems. There's a glimmer of hope in the national education policy that has a vocational education component. But the

point the two points and then I'll stop. The pace and scale of the change that AI is bringing and the inevitable disruptions that it is bringing, we are not prepared for and our institutions

and our policies are not keeping pace with the scale uh you know scale and pace of of AI and and its development. Um and so most people are actually being left out of the kind of AI progress that

you might be hearing in these halls today. So I offer that as my view. I offer that as a provocation and happy to delve deeper. &gt;&gt; Thanks for the reality check uh Sabina

and that's a great great point on which to turn to uh Dr. Cla Melamemed uh vice president for AI and digital cooperation strategy at the UN Foundation. uh CLA this morning as well in a different

panel we were talking about social protection that uh Sabina just referred to uh but the scale of disruption that is coming you've argued before that we need some kind of a global multilateral

approach towards helping countries transition through this uh period of disruption how do we do that &gt;&gt; well if I had a simple answer we wouldn't have all need to needed to

gather in these halls we all do this into a simple answer. [laughter] &gt;&gt; But thank you. No. And um and I think this is absolutely and I'm I was it was great Sabina just to hear from you just

now. I mean I think this you I don't know whether by design or by by accident but this panel flows um very very neatly. I mean I think you know I always have those same alarm bells um as you

mentioned when we you know when we hear about the jobs transition and when we see the figures that make it look like it's a smooth transition at the macro level you see figures about you know the

num the way in which jobs are switching the way in which skills are switching and it's telling an exciting story about opportunities for the future but I think what we often miss is that it's not

always those same individuals who are transitioning out of one job and into another job or out of one set of skills and into another set of skills. That these these changes that we see at the

macro level often represent you know terrifying vertigenous changes that affect individuals in their lives and that they are often not well equipped for. Um, you know, age comes into this

of two. Of course, we tend to focus very much on on young people or on the way that young people can take advantage of new opportunities. And with those figures about the level of unemployment

among young people, it's obviously a huge issue. But you know at the other end of people's working lives if you're the 65 year old worker who is made redundant as a result of technological

change and AI someone may step in to replace that job with a different job but it probably won't be you. So I think you know we need to think about the costs of transition as well as the

benefits. We often focus very much on the benefit and the excitement and that is something that needs to be planned for and realized or else it won't happen. But I think we need to give as

much thought to to how we manage the costs of transition you know all eras of historical of big historical technical change have huge costs as well as benefits even if they're relatively

short term. And you know everything um tells us political history, social history tells us that we we need to think seriously about those costs which kind of does come back of course to

social protection to other kinds of rules. So I think you know just thinking about this at the global level social protection schemes necessarily are primarily tend to be administered at the

national or even the local level in alignment with local contexts and so on. I think that's incredibly important. But I think there are two issues that are worth talking about when we are thinking

about what are the kind of global governance arrangements and global rules that can help countries, people, companies to manage these transitions. One of course is around the

redistribution of wealth. You know in previous eras of technological change when we had pime primarily national economies it was quite easy to say let's redistribute the wealth from um from the

winners to the losers effectively in this um in this moment of change. Of course, that's much harder now if we consider tax as something which sits at the national boundaries because the

winners and the losers are often in different jurisdictions and different continents in very different parts of the world. So if part of the solution is some form of transfer from the winners

to the losers even in the short to help you know even in the short term I think the institutions through which that's going to be done need to be thought about. At the moment we don't really

have the institutions to do that effectively. I don't know what they would be. The political obstacles as we know would be formidable but I think that does need to be a part of change. A

second response to transitions, not just technological or environmental transitions, but any kind of transitions which people always do, which is hugely

um difficult and controversial politically, not least in my country, is of course migration. You know, we can move money to where people are or we can move people to where money is or jobs.

You know, we can move jobs to where people are or we can or people will move to where jobs are. And in an area era of huge upheaval of where the dimensions and of inequalities are shifting that is

always going to be something that people do whether we like it or not. So I think often you know migration is another huge political debate that we talk about in very different contexts but I think that

has to be part of thinking about the global impact of of this big change that we are seeing in our labor markets. Well, it's interesting you brought up the migration issue because the other

aspect of migration is not just the the demand pull of of a more prosperous market but the environmental push uh resulting from a changing climate. Uh which takes us back to which are the

most exposed sectors. I mean Sabina, I want to turn it back to you. Um the we we we've identified as you know at CW we've identified the potential for 48 million new jobs that can be created in

across 36 new value chains in the green economy. But the first question we have to ask is who's going to get impacted more first by the AI disruption as well as the climate disruption. Do you have a

sense on that? &gt;&gt; Sure. So I do think this is a really important conversation in the way that you're articulating it uh Arnaba because if see it's easy to say okay let's look

at the impact of AI on jobs but that's not the only thing that's acting on the labor market right there's also the there's climate change there's also the energy transition imperative there's

pandemics there's trade shocks there's so many factors and at the end of the day all of these forces are affecting you, right? So, it's not just one force. We can't look at these different forces

and silos because the labor market, the group of workers is just one. You're being affected by many things, right? And within that, Ernaba, I like to look at it, you know, rather than sectors

because we look at there's a lot of conversation, a lot of research that talks about what are the next big sectors, right? We can talk about green jobs or we can talk about you know which

uh whether we should invest in labor intensive sectors that are more job creating or um the service you know serviceled growth. At the end of the day I think the fact of the matter is that

people make decisions locally and what we're not doing in the job conversation is having a very local conversation. Right? What do your parents think about your jobs and where you might be able to

go to? That's how people make decisions about jobs, not at the 10,000 foot level. What sectors are growing? Right? So, so that's that's one thing. The second thing I want to say is look at

this in a a socioeconomic uh um segmentation. Right? So if you look at you know this pervasive narrative that developing countries will be less affected right you've all

probably heard this oh we don't you know developing countries will be less affected than industrialized countries because so much of our economy is in the informal sector that is not going to be

exposed to AI right that is just not right because if you think about it there's we have more than 90% of employment is informal employment One way of looking at that is one in 10

jobs is formal and that's such a small number. So if there are disruptions, it's not affecting the overall economy. But let's flip that argument over, right? Let's flip that argument over. If

that is the only number of formal good quality jobs that we have and those jobs are going to be disrupted and dare I say the people in this room are part of the very large youth population that are

going to be applying for those very small number of jobs that are going to become even less right that affects us directly and so this idea that you know and then there's multiplier effects and

then I'll stop you So it's if if the IT sector in Bangalore were to lay off a lot of workers, all the bars and the restaurants and the eeries and they like they stop spending money and then it has

cascading effects across the other parts of the economy too, right? So we need to come down from the macro to the much more local story and we need to think about this in very real pragmatic terms

about how this technology and the disruptions are going to cascade across the economy. Thanks. &gt;&gt; So Prager Sabina has in some ways you know thrown us the challenge and when

you work closely with governments um what would be your advice in terms of helping governments manage this transition in a conscious and an intentional way rather than what Sabina

is highlighting is often we think that the problem is not large enough because we simply not counting the problem in the right way. So what would be an appropriate way of managing this

transition with minimal we can't say no disruption? U OpenAI Academy is also doing stuff. So can you reflect a little bit on what your approach and theory of changes?

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we're very clear that we're not the experts on this for sure. Uh and I think we will have to work with you know people like Sabina and Dr. declare to one understand the problem to

work with them to also find the solution and then therefore together give an advice on what is what should the government be doing around these issues um I'm not trying to skirt the question

I'm just like being I think very candid that you know we have people in within open AI we have a chief economist um you know Dr. Ronni Chattery who we've got on board who is actually thinking about

this day in and day out and we have a whole economic research uh function within the company uh within the research lab to actually think about one how is charg being used across the world

and then therefore also what is the impact of jobs and we did come out with a blueprint last year around this topic where we had uh you know the the the chief economic adviser to the prime

minister's office also come in and talk about his concerns around the the job loss that might happen. And of course, I feel like the conversation has really shifted from, you know, last year

February to obviously where we are today um in in February this year because we can to a very large degree articulate at least what we have seen in the last one year because now the technology is also

evolving and in some way maturing. You know, earlier there was a very limited level of adoption. Now of course we're seeing a very high level of adoption not only just within consumers but also a

lot around enterprises uh like Nirmid was saying and so we did do a report uh in in collaboration with IKR which we just launched actually over the weekend and that clearly says and you know we

did go out and speak to or survey around 650 companies across India um because we wanted to root this conversation in facts there was a lot of this you know that oh there's going to a lot of job

loss and then there were a whole set of people saying there are going to be new jobs so we're all okay and so I think we really wanted to make sure that we are rooting this conversation in a little

bit of survey which is localized and talks to what is happening in India as opposed to a data set which is uh you know international and really doesn't speak to what's going on in the on the

ground and what we've se what we've heard 600 650 companies tell us is that they are slowing down their hiring but at the same time overall growth growth of jobs within their companies is

increasing and of course there's a lot of nuance in that fact and in that stat and you you can feel free to go out and read that report but I think overall what we what we are hearing them say to

us is that they are seeing a lot of their um their engineers and their overall employees not just engineers but people in finance legal HR across functions actually be a lot more

efficient and productive uh with the adoption of AI and so I think really our view on this is that you have to adopt and you have to start using this technology to be able to understand what

that reskilling upskilling looks like because at least what we've seen is that the upskilling is much faster and much easier and we are of course making and taking initiatives like the OpenAI

Academy to be able to provide all of this content for free so that today if you're a teacher you can go out and understand what are the best practices to not just use our models but use AI in

general plus we're also doing similar stuff by launching certifications of open AAI which means the minute you take those courses one you know how to use AI more effectively but also secondly your

employability increases significantly after you take that certification so we want to be part of the solution &gt;&gt; and therefore we want to be able to work with universities with experts to figure

out what's the right path and we're doing a lot around diagnosing the problem as well with Ronnie and our team &gt;&gt; so again both you Pragera and what Aditi presented earlier you're we are clearly

seeing there is a premium applied to whether you have the green skills or whether you have the AI skills. The question is um I think as Sabina was saying uh and what you are also I guess

attempting to do bringing that down to a place-based conversation rather than just a macro conversation. So Nimrit as an entrepreneur uh what would you say are I mean if you had to give some kind

of you know green shoots of enthusiasm out to the policy makers uh what would you say are India's core strengths in its skill skill base or in its kind of demographic base or otherwise which we

can present as here here are some strengths that we could leverage through this transition and disruption. Yeah. Uh so I'll first I'll use the word I think. So with AI and jobs uh I'm cautiously

optimistic. That's the word I would use. So of course we need to be cautious but we also need to be optimistic. See as humanity we run on hope and I can say that without having any

agenda on either sides because I also run the biggest human job network for 0 to 7 years which is youth of India and on the same time we also have blue machines AI which is on the AI agentic

AI side. So I can be probably uh very I would say bipartisan in in some shape and form as I talk about this. So at least my perspective on what we are seeing see uh and before Microsoft Excel

came out in some ship and form there was like a whole building of people doing calculations and modeling. Once Microsoft Excel came out all of this modeling work was done by Excel. these

people got out from the repetitive task and started doing something creative and in today's world and I'm talking about AI today uh and I really believe AGI is really far away I think so it's not

going to be that like that humanity is going to get destroyed it's far away so in today's world as I see the jobs are getting unbundled in some shape and form the repetition part of the jobs is going

to go away humans are going to be more creative for example yesterday I was using one AI tool to build. I was with my marketing department. We were trying to build a advertisement and in that

advertisement we were trying to say that say a guy is driving the car and and then and we we have but we had to specify the guy's driving the car but the shoot angle has to be from this side

and then the car moves in this side. So all of the directorship or that creativity is still human and I think so we humans are best at creativity and that is what we do more and we will

start seeing that more jobs going in that direction. I will also see again there's going to be a very big rise if the two jobs if I'm going to bet on for future is FDE forward deployment

engineering because a lot of times big organizations struggle on how do you go and apply AI like say it's a trucking business they want to apply AI if you don't understand trucking very well

enough you cannot apply AI there so think about that transitioning that job I think so that will be very important eval is going to be a very very big thing for India

I'm really really looking forward to that. See India is a very very complex environment multilingual multis sectoral there are different cultures and to and to ensure that AI works in that way. So

we are we are seeing and we are seeing a lot of work happening in that direction and where we have a frontier small lab at UPNA which is actually building those data sets which big model companies will

use in future. So that will be world models are coming up in future I think. So a lot of work is going to get happening there. We are also building data sets there. So as we see a lot of

this are new jobs that are getting created. So at least my perspective is I don't think so if I am a graduate or I am say maybe two years into a job I will not lose my job to AI but I will lose my

job to a person who uses AI. So at least my perspective is going to be there. Try and learn new skills. I I don't think so we can be like an ostrich saying that AI is going to change the world. what do I

do? I think so get the head up as a as a young person getting into professional world. See where you can apply AI because see AI can do a lot of mundane task but nuances is what we humans are

good at. Use your power of imagination nuances ask the right questions use AI to then scale it to this and we'll hopefully go to a world of extreme abundance and I really hope uh hope that

we go in that direction. Uh let let's let's stop at extreme abundance and and turn to uh uh CLA because we've had a diverse discussion on on on the micro issue that uh Sabina Praa and Nirmid

have identified and there's a good story to tell and there is a uncomfortable story to confront but back to uh governance at a national level or a global level. Um political leaders uh

might be aware of the micro but have to articulate a macro and that's where nuance gets lost. How do we balance this diversity of views when it comes to developing those guard rails, those

cushions that you want some international cooperation on? What's the biggest risks we want to confront? I mean I think that the the international conversation on AI is as

we all know and as we see here very fragmented and it's perhaps better to think of it as several conversations. There is a conversation about safety and the sort of existential risk element

which is different to this conversation about jobs. Um there are overlaps but it's just a different conversation and that's okay. Not everything has to be about everything. Um, I mean, I think on

this jobs question, as I say, I think there's two ways to look at it, and I can see that we have one minute left, so let me try to be as quick as I can. I think one is for governments to do the

things they've always done, but just do them in a new context. You know, governments have always thought about employment. It's one of the main reasons why governments fall is when um is when

there is high unemployment and governments are not meeting people's aspirations. So of course public policy is often very much dominated by questions of employment. That's going to

be the same. It's just in this new context. Governments have always thought about skills. They've always thought about social protection. So I think there's a way in which the AI

conversation is not new. It's just a reformulation of exactly the same public policy issues that have always dominated political debate, but with the new opportunities and risks and therefore I

think a level of um a level of urgency that perhaps we we haven't um seen for a while. There are of course some specific things that governments can do that they must do that are responding specifically

to the opportunities and the threats of AI um which are in the areas that we've discussed here skills social protection all of those things. I would like to see my last point I I do think there is a

problem with leadership. I do think that although there are many governments who talk a lot about AI and it's a train that everybody wants to be on, I do think that we perhaps have seen a

little bit less in the way of specific actions confronting the complexities. Everybody wants to be the person who shakes hands over the new data center in their country and things that look

great. people are a little bit bit less keen to talk about what the implic what the costs and be might be and how they as governments have a responsibility for managing transitions

but finally you know governments do stuff because we as citizens make them do stuff ultimately you know I think we can't pass the buck to companies any more than we can pass the buck to to

companies or to anybody else if we want this to happen ultimately it always comes back, you know, as the jobs question does, it always comes back to the individual and to what we want.

&gt;&gt; Oh, that's that's uh that focus on ultimately our our individual responsibility is spot on. All sorts of sirens and bells are going off. Uh uh I I I guess I mean that's a sign that we

got to all wake up. I think what we've got from this panel, I'm really sorry that we don't have time for questions, but we've got from this panel is on one hand the huge opportunity that exists in

terms of the clean transition. We at CW say let's create clean markets that don't exist. I guess we now have to create clean labor markets that don't exist. And I think the the data that uh

Aditi shared the the tool that Weber of my colleague shared but also what uh Nirmid you as an entrepreneur are trying to do Praa you what you're trying to do with your stakeholders

uh uh Sabina you shining the spotlight on the uncomfortable things and then CLA you trying to take it up to the the the halls of the powers that be uh I think it just demonstrates that this is not

going to be solved uh by any single individual or stakeholder. It is a partnership but that requires intentionality. Um we are here to partner with all of you. Um but all of

you out there uh good luck in retaining your jobs or getting a new one. Thank you. [applause] They want to give us some momentum.

[laughter] and only great I think you just carried the whole an opportunity. This white paper has been truly an incredibly uh

collaborative effort between a lot of different stakeholders from the ecosystem. How the idea started was with a simple fact. With every technological revolution that has happened in the

past, the fear of jobs is there at the ground. And how do we address that? You know, be it the industrial revolution, the internet or the cloud, all have started with natural concerns around job

fair. But if you look at history also proves that these new opportunities have created new pathways for growth, career development and for prosperity of the community at large. With this we are

hoping that today our white paper will guide all of you on how AI can shape a narrative journey for not just India but all of us individually as well. At process we are doing our bit to unlock

AI first world for our two billion customers and we believe that this technology is growing at an unprecedented rate. With that objective um you know our idea was very simple. We

wanted to get deep dive uh take a deep dive into five core sectors for the India's economy and understand how AI is really shaping the narrative for those sectors. over the over the past few

months I would say six months you've gathered 150 plus experts across industry startups innovators and policy makers got them in a room together had hours long of conversation I see a lot

of you here from our roundts and thank you to each one of you who contributed to this this initiative actually is the brainchild of Mr. Arch Chandra Shakha and Siraj who's here with us who have

you know conceptualized this from the start and nurtured it to the place where we have come so far. So truly thank you both for shaping this narrative and helping us come this far. Um I remember

Abhishek sir when we first presented this concept to you RC sir was on call Siraj and we were in the room. Um you know we were hoping that the the idea resonates well with you but you and your

department have been so grateful to us within 48 hours we had a green signal to go ahead and plan everything. And this morning I learned that 48 hours was also a stretch. You had on the spot decided

to give us a go ahead. But thank you sir to you and your department um for shaping and allowing us to be a partner in this journey with you. With that I understand you have a busy schedule. I

would like for the audience to hear from you. I you know this summit has opened you know such great heights on what India can do for the world and you know you're not just the man of the hour but

the man of the decade in this AI world. And I now invite Mr. Abhishek Singh um to take the stage and give his opening remarks. &gt;&gt; [applause]

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh first and foremost, I would like to congratulate the entire team especially led by Archan Shikhar to whom I owe it to bringing me to this whole domain of

digital government and technology in which I am spending like now my 10th year in the building that he ushered me in as a young deputy secretary way back in 2009. So many thanks to you sir. I've

learned a lot from you and in fact when the thought came when Siraj came and told me and Siraj also I met in Kennedy school so when he came and told me that we want to do this I said why not let's

go ahead how quickly we can do this it's great that this whole thing has come to fruition and uh all these sectors all these five reports that came in the five roundts that happened I was able to

attend I think one or two only three three one online and two in person so great discussions great group of experts who chaired Ashokati is here with whom I had the fortune of working on the when

in 2014 on the expert committee on uh re reimagining FCIE no restructuring of FCI so that time so all the panels really had contributed a lot and the report that has come out the the white paper

will be something that will come will become a policy prescription for many departments if they so wish from health I have heard good reviews So you have shared with almost all the

domains and I'm sure every department will have a lot of learning there will ensure that this is not only put on website which is actively shared with all the state governments and kind of

helps us create a road map of what we can do and in a way this is this is the way we had tried to design our impact summit as well that instead of just being a talking shop we kind of come out

with some concrete deliverables and towards that objective we started early we started with the presummit events we engaged multiple experts experts instead of government doing all the sessions, we

got experts from all domains to join in, chip in and it became like everybody's summit. So there is so much of inclusion in this whole curating the agenda for the summit that is leading to what we

are seeing cues of people from day one coming in and uh in fact we were wondering when we're planning the whole event we were focusing on the big days when we had the celebrity speakers and

we were thinking the first day will be easy because we didn't have any celebrity speakers but those of you who were here yesterday could have seen it was no less than a cold play concert

people walking in so so thanks to the effort that you all put through the various uh sessions the presummit events through the deliberations and I'm sure this white paper will continue to guide

us in days to come but this is not the end the engagement with process and team is just the beginning while we go ahead in executing this we look forward to continuing your support and in fact it's

good to see your chair also here because your meeting with the honorable prime minister in South Africa he has referred to it on almost every meeting that we have had are they coming so confirming

this good to see you here and uh And I'm sure the deliberation that follows with the expert panel will be will be very engaging. I'm sorry I will not be able to stay for the whole session but look

forward to learning more from what happened here. Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. We're truly grateful for mateies and India's mission support in this entire journey for us. Our next

speaker has truly been the northstar for us for this entire duration of the project. Right. From conceptualizing it to spearheading all the anchor. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I think we can release it in presence.

Yes. Yes. Okay. So, can I also invite Nicola David Yuro Saharaj uh Tu from BCG to be on the stage. We'll do the report unveiling in the presence of Abhishek and then we'll continue as per the

agenda. Can I have more books please? Last minute. Imagine Imagine what Okay. So, we have gone ahead with the

report launch. Um, we'll share a QR code for all of us as well, you know, to download and look at the report. We have some copies here for you to share as well. But moving on, as per the agenda,

I'd now like to invite Mr. Rachandra Shakhar. As I was mentioning, sir has been um uh the chief project mentor right from conceptualizing this project to helping shape every narrative. He's

coached all our roundts and he's truly been an amazing mentor uh in this entire journey. Sir, thank you so much. Um I'd love for you to now set the context for the audience.

Um thank you AA for that introduction and uh very good evening to uh all the audience distinguished audience here uh my fellow panelists and

fellow co-chairs Saharaj and the team from process David Allen if he's here and uh the very very competent team from BCG who have helped craft this entire uh document and put it all together based

on the roundts. So I thought I'll just uh share a little uh backdrop of the five round tables. The co-chairs will speak on the specific areas. I think it's now pretty well

recognized that AI is a defining technology of this century. Although we are just into the third decade of this century and it's touching every sphere of human activity including cognitive

and even creative functions. Its impact has been and is continuing to be deep and wide. It impacts growth, it impacts equity and it impacts jobs.

The technology itself is borderless and universal but the uh effects are not. So context matters and matters hugely for India. The opportunities are clear. Vast digital capabilities which the

country is now known for. Rising technology entrepreneurship which has been the story of the last couple of decades. progressive policies from the government and all of this sitting

alongside pressing gaps in human development and the needs of human development. But I think the fact is that despite the power of AI, the benefits will not come

automatically to the country. So this series of five sectoral roundts covering uh five sectors uh uh healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, education and uh finance

uh were taken as important sectors but also exemplars for what is possible in any sector. If you put the best minds together and in each of the round tables we had some of the

best minds in the country with practical experience not just conceptual or theoretical knowledge and then uh try find and uh you know identify a path which actually suits the Indian context.

The goal was really to maximize equitable growth and job creation. And it turns out it's quite interesting that the narrative in a lot of western countries has been agentic AI slowly

taking over human functions and that naturally leads to apprehensions of job losses. But uh India can chart a different path as it turns out for a variety of reasons

but only with deliberate design and carefully crafted and tailored to India's reality. In order to do that what emerges is actually that we have to address two

levels simultaneously. One is the level of innovation point solutions for specific problems which entrepreneurs and innovative startups are particularly good at. They

can drive that part of the agenda. But the second level is also equally important when you are looking at a transformation of an entire sector and that is the ecosystem level foundations

where government plays a critical role. such as standards, digital public infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, uh clearly defined roles for the state and for the private sector and well

balanced data policies which protect the rights of people on one hand and yet unlock the vast pool of data for creating safe and relevant AI. This white paper is not and should not

be viewed as a conceptual exercise or a theoretical framework. It is actually a very practical approach based on working ground level examples which are there on the ground today in each of the sectors

and they are cited at great length in the papers in each sector and these well doumented instances also cover the other level uh which is the ecosystem level and the infrastructural

level and the uh foundations but at the same time it's not as if because those two are getting addressed, the change will happen. There are gaps. There's no question about that. There

are gaps that need to be filled to enable sectoral transformation at scale and these two have been spelt out in the white paper based on the consultations. So I'll just give one or two examples

and I will not go too much into the details. For example, in healthcare, there are startups which have demonstrated and are actually providing a service which captures a direct

conversation between a person, maybe a health professional, maybe not, and a patient in the local language, whatever is the local language in that state in India, and converts it into a medical

case sheet ready for use by a doctor. And that has the benefit that it really reduces the crunches the time that a specialist has to uh devote to a particular patient.

There's no reason why this can't be done across the length and breadth of the country. We need to do it and we need to figure out what is holding that back. There are uh certain areas like uh

regulatory steps uh including standardization which are needed to scale such development so that they are transportable across uh different uh institutions medical healthcare

institutions and different specialists. Similarly in the area of uh agriculture there are uh uh you know entrepreneurs who provide uh drone based services which allow precision agriculture. You

know in India farmers are not going to invest the capital required to buy drones much less learn how to operate them on their own. That's not the way the Indian economy works. It's going to

be all provided as a service where everything is consumed as a service and in the process of providing that service huge employment opportunities get created and according to one estimate

provision of such services on a wide scale can lead to an employment of as many as 1 cr people in India with 50 lakh drones at a 50% penetration rate in agriculture as compared to an 80%

penetration rate in China. So there's a huge amount of potential for growth and for equitable growth and for providing employment opportunities. There are many benefits which flow out

of this apart from the employment obviously the you know it leads to savings for the farmer because of precision uh agriculture less water consumed less fertilizer consumed less

pesticide consumed more sustainable agriculture but I'm sure professor Gulati will speak much more uh you know authoritatively on that area and many others as well so I'm just wanted to

flag this as an example of how growth equity and job creation can happen simultaneously using AI. But the important thing is that the policy has to be aligned with the use of

technology. So if you have as uh is the case some in India in some areas like agriculture if you have a policy which subsidizes the inputs and in a way indirectly promotes proflegate use of

such inputs then AI which helps you to optimize them is unlikely to succeed. unlikely to provide a viable business case, unlikely to support an entrepreneurial startup.

So there are such uh many such uh examples but I will in the interest of time I will uh move forward to the ecosystem level things which are already happening in India and in many of the

sectors local entrepreneurs at the front end they provide they front end whatever services are available digitally the sophistication and the technology is at the back end the front end is a human uh

person uh pro and that helps helps in the especially in the Indian context which is a very tightlyknit society especially in the rural areas to provide trust empathy reliability and

accountability all of which are not currently AI's strong suits for example in India the community service centers the CSC's [snorts] there's a half a million such centers

across the country which currently employ 2 million people and this is without any government expense they are all uh self-employed That's a testimony to the workability a

and the employment generation potential for such extensions of uh the services. We also have DPIs which are working at population scale like uh for example the UPI the payments interface the Aadhaar

which is the ID the digital identity and uh so on and all of these I think uh show India's execution capability at scale. So extending some of these pieces whether at the ecosystem level or

entrepreneurs working at the uh specific problem and specific solution level and then uh fitting these pieces of the jigsaw puzzle together in a meaningful way are what would deliver the kind of

value that India needs and seeks. So for each of the sectors there are actions which are needed by various stakeholders which have been elaborated in the white paper. the components that are already

available and the gaps that are there also have been indicated and the supporting policies have also been spelt out. I'm not going to say more than that because I'm actually hoping that you

will read the white paper. So if I say everything there may not be enough reason to do that. So I will uh leave it now to uh my co-chairs to detail the assessment and recommendations for each

of the sectors. But I would just like to add that AI definitely can create a lot of jobs in healthcare, education, agriculture, manufacturing and finance and probably

many other sectors also which we were not able to touch. It enables assisted uh access to services. But equally importantly in a country like India, it bridges skill gaps. It

generates at one level highskilled technology roles which some people who are already in the tech sector can be molded to uh fit into and also a lot of low skill level people who can do much

higher skill jobs provided they are supported by AI and both are uh possible with very limited amount of training. So in that sense it is actually able to contribute substantially on a net basis

to India's uh employment. India's digital track record shows that when the goals and the roles are clear, scale and speed follow and the challenge now as the uh recommendation show is in

execution turning these insights into delivery and intent into measurable impact. The report aims to catalyze that phase and bring all the stakeholders together in a consortium or as a

grouping which will carry this forward and subsume more and more people into this partnership to work amongst themselves as well as in close partnership with the government. Before

I conclude, I want to thank the team from process uh here, Siraj Asta and the team uh which has been backing them uh for the tremendous uh work in driving and organizing these consultations from

start to finish as Abhishek Singh said it's not easy to take this through to its conclusion and uh the BCG team which was very very competent and uh which actually crafted together you you know

uh the all the consultations in the round table into this white paper I was joking with somebody that if you uh were there in the round tables uh you would find you might find it somewhat

difficult to relate it to the very coherent wellthoughtout recommendations in the white paper uh because there were so many diverse views but I think that impossible task has been managed very

well thanks to BCG and finally of course matey you heard from Abhishek Singh himself the country mission AI mission leader and I think what better shot in the arm can there be than that he was

here for the release and has uh underlined the importance that the government attaches to this uh white paper. So thank you all very much and uh it's great to be able to talk to you

here. Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you Mr. Chandra Shaker. It's been an absolute pleasure learning from the best. We will now move on to the sectoral flash insights quick high

impact perspectives distilled from u you know the months of research that we've been undergoing. Starting with the agriculture sector our focus was on AI as a tool for rural resilence and

scaling deployments increasing farmer share in the last pie and we are very delighted to have Padmashri Dr. Asho Gulati whose entire life and research has been dedicated to this field. Sir I

invite you on stage now. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you very much uh AA and all protocols observed. Let me straight get to the point because she says 5 minutes upper limit 6 minutes.

India's biggest challenge on this planet is going to be ensuring food and nutritional security for its population. We are 1.45 billion today. We are going to be 1.67 billion by 2050.

We have 18% of the world population, only 10% of the arable area and only 4% of the freshwater resources. This is going to be a big challenge with rising incomes. These underfed millions

are going to demand more and better food. Therefore, are we going to meet that demand? How do we do that?

So far, India is lucky. In my childhood, I had seen literally famine type situation, drought, back-to-back droughts and PL480 and all that story. Today, we have emerged as

the largest exporter of rice in the world. But the future in this race to produce more, we have damaged our soils. They are in

ICU. water table in Punjab Hana the green revolution belt is going down by one and a half ft every year. The greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity all are being

lost. This business as usual cannot deliver us and cannot assure us food security in the long run. Technology has to help and AI is the one

which tells us how to produce more with less. That is where precision agriculture has to come in. Precision agriculture already is being used in number of countries in the west.

You go to John Deere in US and you see behind the tractor see and spray technology and they will spray only what is needed. With the same water, with the same land and with the same or less

fertilizers, you can produce much more. To give you an example, China has a lesser arable area 129 million hectares. Our aable area is 159 million hectares. Their production of agriculture is

double than ours. That is with the existing technology. The moment you bring in AI into the picture, you can ensure a lot. So first is sustainability through precision agriculture and the

application of AI in that. As you rightly said, every farmer cannot buy that capital equipment to do that and therefore we will have to uberize the tractors the precision farming uh

implements. So think about uberization of drones and tractors and harvest combines equipped with AI facility. With that I think you can turn it around. food security we have achieved today.

I'm hopeful that we will be able to ensure enough food on the table in the years to come. What is lacking and for next 20 years? Our challenge is nutritional security.

The wheat and rice of today has at least 30% less zinc than what it used to have in 1960s and 70s. that zinc deficiency because our soils have become deficient in zinc because we are overusing

chemicals of ura because of the policy that Mr. Chandra Shakhar referred to that distortion is creating imbalanced use of resources especially chemical fertilizers leading to deficiency in the

soil and therefore deficiency in the crops and therefore deficiency stunting is caused one of the reasons is stunting is being caused by lack of zinc in our wheat and rice. Now how AI can

help the genome mapping has been done. The gene editing is going to be the future come what may and with that you can bring in traits with higher biofortification of higher zinc and

wheat and rice. So that's how many of these problems will have to be sorted out. So food security, nutritional security, climate change because climate change is on our head no matter what the

US thinks about it. One degree temperature up and this is the February month 5 million tons of wheat will be gone. If from the normal spike of one week in temperature you

will lose at least 5% of wheat. Now how do we tackle that? Again climate resilient varieties by putting in those traits through gene editing by using AI. AI can do today in very short time what

the normal breeding processes of change would do over years. So that's the miracle that is going to happen. What we have done in the last 50 years, I think next 10 to 15 years of AI application is

going to do much more than that. But I need to talk about jobs. This limited use and precision farming is going to lead to growth. And when the cake increases,

okay, time check, one minute only. Growth is what creates jobs. We can produce double of what we are producing today and that is what will create jobs and a better job high skilled jobs I

think with that and building value chains. Uh unfortunately we still talked about production not the marketing part but a lot can be done on the marketing also by using AI and blockchain

technologies. Thank you very much. Thank you Dr. Gulati. I'm sure with your dedication we'll have some of these recommendations implemented soon. I'm going to request every speaker to please

limit to two to three minutes. I will be strict with the time now. But moving on um to the education you know as a parent to two beautiful girls. This was an eye openener session for me for the fact

that with uh Chad GPT and Gemini teaching the subject learning uh what you know students are learning in school becomes all the more important from social intelligence to emotional and

with that um I would request my next co-chair Manit Jen he was the former chair at Viki Arise and co-founder of IM teacher and founder at human learning man over to you.

&gt;&gt; She gave me five minutes now I have three. Okay. So, India has achieved something historic. If you look at access figures, 96% universal access, 14 lakh schools,

24 crore students, 1 cr teachers. We've got the largest education system in the world. But there are failures at two counts. One is at the level of quality and the other even more glaring is at

the level of relevance. So we all know that many of the graduates even from the best institutions in the country lack basic employability skills which means they're not equipped for jobs of today.

Uh I shudder to imagine what it means in the AI revolution. So we cannot only work on quality. Uh so we can't just keep working on fixing quality over the next 20 years. We'll have to parallelly

work on relevance. Otherwise we might be in a situation where we've improved quality in that what is not relevant for the future. The structural friction at all levels.

Teachers are overburdened. Students that are lacking behind find it impossible to catch up. Parents have no real-time visibility. And administrators are data rich but insight poor.

In an AIdriven world, a system that is lowquality and slow paced, slow to adapt, does not just fall behind. It becomes obsolete. And that's a genuine fear that

we have right now. So it's not a tooling issue. It's more an architecture issue. And we look at five meaningful pillars in this reform. The first one being uh lifelong learning and personalized

learning. When I went to school, it was very clear that on every examination day, I was relieved that now I don't have to remember this for the rest of my life.

That was the industrial age paradigm of education. Now you can't afford to not learn continuously at all ages. You will have to learn. You'll have to adapt. The good news is that there are technologies

available now that will meet the child exactly where the child is. My god, the teacher role needs to change from being the teacher of a subject to becoming the teacher of the child. With

the technology available, teachers and institutions should be able to reclaim time. And I think another challenge that we'd have to work on very seriously is parental awareness and parental

literacy. How do you even parent in these times? So the policy recommendations that we have and I'll skip most of them uh as you read them in the report hopefully.

uh one is for a unified platform where teachers, students, the government institutions, everybody comes together one platform which provides personalized learning to students, AI tutors which

provides personalized coaching to teachers uh which they've not had rather than having episodic trainings. The second recommendation is to somehow eventually get to a place and as soon as

possible where a device and a learning device and an internet connection becomes part of the right to education itself. I think we will have to provide that since you

failed to provide teachers quality teachers to every child. Ed tech startups will have to move beyond again subject delivery to areas like social emotional learning, physical literacy,

financial literacy. We'll have to work on all of the areas that are going to be more relevant in the times to come. Uh and uh yes, I think I I think I'll stop here, but I definitely want to say that

uh these are very disruptive times. We're facing a revolution and evolutionary measures or just tweaking around the edges is not going to suffice especially in education. So if we're

just improving on models of subject delivery uh then our models will definitely fail. But there is great hope for democratization of education and I'm sure the policy makers are watching and

together we'll be able to make that difference. &gt;&gt; Thank you Manit for keeping it very crisp and on time. Thank you. We'll quickly move on to the next sector which

is healthcare. For healthcare we had Dr. Swami Swami Natan who was co-chairing the session but she could not join us today. So we have uh the MDN partner from healthcare practice at BCG. I

invite you over &gt;&gt; and please three minutes. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I will try to catch up a little bit but thank you so much on behalf of BCG for giving us this

opportunity to share our views. Uh healthcare itself uh as you all know is is pretty much a daily miracle in India. Uh we have low infrastructure, low resources, uneven access but you know so

much so that in most other countries this would have resulted into some social chaos and unrest. But in India we are delivering high quality competitive care uh which is actually also

significantly improving in terms of outcomes. 20 years back when I started my healthcare journey uh institutional deliveries were standing at 39%. Today we are at 90% plus life expectancy has

grown grown above 72 years. Uh financial coverage which used to be a very very big issue in the past right now we are looking at out of pocket in India at less than 40%. So we have moved

significantly but as often said the last mile is where it all breaks or or that's the most difficult one. Journey ahead is going to be difficult and challenging. There is a large space to cover to reach

global benchmarks and in the context facing structural challenges that India has two3 of our population reside in tier 2 3 four cities and villages which is very very difficult to get quality

clinicians. Access is uneven. To give you an example, in Kerala we have one doctor for 500 people. In Nagaland we have one doctor for 5,000 people. So that's the kind of discrepancy that we

are living in. Of course, diagnostic penetration and all of that is also a very very big challenge. And then you know this has to keep up with the changing nature of disease burden in

India. Moving from communicable disease to now significant proportion of our disease burden falling in non-communicable disease. I think our our workforce has done a great job to

make this space datari. Uh health workers on a day-to-day basis are collecting a lot of data unfortunately in physical copies but it is sent up for rec for recording and reporting. That's

where we believe that AI can play a very very important role. If that data can be connected across programs across systems and standardized we will see a massive unlock opportunity.

uh we believe AI can amplify human capacity and be a real force multiplier to deliver access with quality. Uh when the group were deliberating on potential opportunities, we arrived at four. Let

me cover them quickly. Access at scale. Uh profer spoke a little bit about what kind of access can be created using tools. Right now there are solutions which can actually measure cough on a

phone and predict what kind of TB uh incidents can be there. Imagine that being available to you know health workers on the ground uh and then coupled with triage and prioritized uh

access which can unlock capacity not only at the ground but also unlock specialist capacity because only the high-risisk cases would be going to the specialist and care would be given at

the right equity. The second one is around quality again the voice scribe that uh uh Mr. Stan Shaker spoke about uh think about that in the hands of the health workers on

the ground which is actually communicating with the patient helping the health worker get the latest and greatest of information real time there and then and be able to give solutions

which are appropriate. Uh it reduces subjectivity. It enables uh you know the health workers to get trained uh faster and and you know better implementation of processes. Of course, cost burdens,

better actionable insights are stuff that is very very obvious. Uh we believe significant amount of job opportunities getting implemented. You know, whether these are talent who will build these

solutions, but also clinical capabilities to use this. Uh of course, uh you know, the the paper speaks a lot about what needs to be done. We'll need to do it in an ethical and safe manner.

But I think there is enough evidence uh and capability in the system to be able to execute it. Uh over uh thank you. &gt;&gt; So there's a lifetime counter now running on the screen for the session to

end on time but we have three more speakers and a lot of insights to follow. Moving on to the next uh manufacturing. Um TP sir I'll invite you now to run us through this.

Good afternoon. Um, anybody, how many people in this room from manufacturing? Fantastic. Great. Great. This is for us guys. Thank you. Good to see you. Um, I'm going to make this very very quick.

Uh, manufacturing is a is a topic very very close to my heart. Uh, I've been in manufacturing most of my life. Uh, but I think the opportunity we have is once in a lifetime. Uh the journey started

because some months ago uh I got a call from the government saying that listen you guys do a lot of work on AI for the large companies why can't we bring AI to all our MSMES in India and I started

thinking about it and I really appreciate the opportunity that Siraj you and Mr. Chandra Shika gave me to work on this report. I don't know how many how many of you know in this room

but we have our MSME sector in India employs 230 million people. It produces 30% of India's GDP and 50% of India's exports. That's how important it is. So when we

started doing more research about this whole area, we found that a lot of these MSMES struggle with a few things. Lack of capital, lack of technology, lack of resources and lack of the ability to

actually do all this and that's what actually came out of the report. But what I get really excited is this. All of us in this room that are come from a world of manufacturing the amount of

data that actually gets processed is only about one one and a half percent. Now think of what we can do if we can take the power of all the big AI that's happening out there and what's happening

this whole conference and apply it on the factory floor. That's what we need to do because that's the only way we in India can transform manufacturing going forward. So my goal in life is through

with all of us help if we can find technology and solutions at an affordable price to bring what happens on the big AI on the cloud down to every factory floor in India we will transform

manufacturing. So I hope all of you have a look at the report and hopefully give us back your feedback and ideas to really make a huge amount of difference in manufacturing in India. So thanks

very much. [applause] Thank you sir for keeping true to the time. I appreciate it. &gt;&gt; Moving on to the final sector before we head for the closing remarks. I would

now invite Mr. Vikas Sagnihotri who was co-chair of a finance round table. Thanks Vicas. &gt;&gt; You got up easy. &gt;&gt; I can go. Good evening uh uh ladies and

gentlemen and uh thank you for being here at this point of time and I'm sure you're here because of the fact that you do believe that AI is going to have a massive impact uh on all of humanity. In

fact, it's going to create more opportunities than any other technology so far has. There's no doubt about that. We in India on the finance side are actually in a really good state just

because of the finance stack that we have. It's a it's a stack that helps us uh you know process massive amount of transactions with speed. It has scale and it also helps us inclusion. And we

just heard about TP in terms of talking about the MSME opportunity. So I'm going to really give you a very brief uh uh opportunity in terms of structural headroom that exists which the financial

services really needs to look at and and try and solve for. We have a credit inclusion gap. uh think about the fact that uh we have almost um uh if if think about the individuals and MSmemes that

are outside of the formal credit uh it it the opportunity there is three lakh cr uh of lending that 70 million of the MSMES don't get today because while the systems exist there are other things

that uh that are a problem in terms of trying to reach them maybe they don't have a footprint they don't have a credit uh uh credit infrastructure doesn't really uh help them to get onto

a formal um uh the formal economy. So I will AI help of course it will help. You have cross and productivity issues. Uh we have actually seen that over the past uh decade uh opex costs have gone up by

11%. You have uh you have actually uh IT cost growing at 16.8% 8% on a kagger basis and real income is actually uh has actually been around 11%. So what has to change if we have to survive? It has to

be productivity. How will productivity come in? It'll come in by technology, by AI and many other things that will happen in terms of redefining some of the processes and systems that we

actually work on. We also have a risk uh asset um cyclical risk and asset quality stress that we do see. If you are in lending, if you've been in finance, uh you know there is a cyclical risk that

happens. Uh you will also know that every person, every lender is always worried about delinquency ratios. They are worried about in terms of uh you know in terms of how do you do

collections on time etc. And many of those decisions actually then color the fact that you do you want to play a safer game and you don't want to go into the financial inclusion that we need to

look at at this point of time. So will AI help? Of course it will help and there's a big opportunity over there. We also have a deposit stress you know when lending goes uh the fact of the matter

is that between uh 2013 to 2023 we've actually had a drop in the in the deposit ratio in household savings from 67% to about 40 45%. So we have a big issue in terms of

uh that uh that area because uh if you look at banks if they have to manage an asset liability mismatch this is this causes this is what causes a bigger problem and AI again will actually help

in terms of inclusion and bringing it together again we have a protection gap you know you have an underinsured population less than 4% of people uh are are uh are insured in this country so

how do we get understand more of them reach out more of them relook at the underwriting that we actually look at again AI I with data and different kind of data will actually help you do that.

um you have you know all kinds of other risks that are that are on we how will you know in terms of AI will it unlock opportunities of course you've heard so many other people talk about it and

there is no doubt of the fact that AI is going to uh address opportunities I think we are all in good state uh some of this will actually happen in a pretty pretty uh near and and visible future

but to do some of those things lot has to change and we've tried in the report to actually give examples in terms of traditional BFS exercise some of them have to really redefine and reinvent

themselves. Um I mean to give you a very simple example if you were to you know if it if you were building a car which and you said that you want like you know the car to have a mileage going up from

15 km a liter to 25 km you will re retweak the engine. But if you were to set yourself a goal that you want to do 100 km a liter you know you have to redef you have to restart again because

the current system will not work which is what I think the traditional BFSI stuff will have to do. And you have the regulators helping out. Finexs and technology providers will also have to

work into something like this in terms of you know uh how do they uh bring everything in panel and again industry bodies have to bring all of these things uh with one voice on the same page and

and work this together. Thank you very much. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you Vicas. I'm sorry for cutting you all short but we are stretched on time and the next session has to start

on time but Whippin I'll invite you now. Weapon has been instrumental with this BCG team tto sai and everyone here to help us distill this insights and to conclude the uh synthesis from the white

paper. &gt;&gt; Good evening everyone. So I think we heard from all the co-chairs as well as Mr. Chandra in terms of uh the insights across the report but I just want to

leave you with four points. The first one is uh there's a lot of discussion around whether AI will take away jobs. I think in India the imperative is it's it's less about AI replacing jobs. It's

more about uh how the productivity can be taken up how the access can be improved with AI whether it's healthcare whether it's education whether it's agree and so on so forth. So the we are

far away from the concern of AI taking away jobs. So it's a AI AI is a force multiplier for us in that sense. The second uh thing I want to leave with all of you is uh as we think about as an

ecosystem as we think about this I think we need to plan for a sovereignity on the space both as a nation as well as as an entity as a nation we should think about sovereign LLM servering stack etc

so that we don't have dependence on the western or the eastern nations for this and as an organization as we think about adopting AI it's important for us to create stacks which are more agnostic

modular etc so that depending on how the geopolitical situations arise we can move away from whether an Open AI or a geminy or a let's say Alibaba based stack. The third thing is as as as

industry all of you think about uh the have a coherent AI strategy so that uh we can plan for the future and do it in a more uh scalable manner and move away from the doing just PC's and actually

start delivering impact because of AI. The last point I would leave all of you with is it's not a this is not a effort which can be taken up by one entity. I think it's a collective effort of the

government of the uh the fintech ecosystem of the startup ecosystem of the policy makers of let's say education students and so on so forth. It's a collective effort of all of you to make

make this happen make this change happen. There's no doubt that with all of this the the future is going to be disruptive for all of us. Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Vin to you and the team at PCG. And we're now towards the last and the end of the session. Euro I invite you for your closing remarks and thank you so much for joining us uh to

be here in India for the AI summit. Everyone Euro is the global head of AI for process NASOS groups and he's especially here to join us for this session. Euro over to you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Thank you AA. Um it's a great pleasure to be here first of all and um I first want to thank Abishek Singh from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology

Archandra Secar and the BCG team for their partnership. Thank you very much. Um it's a significant period to be in India and I think the Indian government has been able to put in place put in

motion with this AI summit in particular something that's going to be an example for everyone. So so you're setting the pace you're setting the example here. I

spent decades &gt;&gt; I'll do that anyway. That's fine. All right. So I'll spend decades building AI systems. I spent all my career building AI systems and I'm deeply convinced that

this is the inflection time that things are really changing. This is a new era that is going to affect all of us. And then we are going from chat bots and all image generation that was fun and so on.

And we are working on um agents so things that do things for us. They carry out work. They carry out complex processes. If you go into some of our offices around the globe, you see the

signs for the employees. Build an agent so you can do something better, right? It's it's affecting everybody. So in our company, we built about 40,000 agents. So the employees in our companies are

build the agents for their own work, right? They build because they'll make their work better. They drive efficiency, productivity in their everyday life. And it is just the

beginning. This process started about 12 months ago. So we are just at the beginning of all this. The next wave is going to be millions of these agents, right? And yes, they are not meant to

replace humans and then we just don't want to replace humans, but they will change work. They will change societies. So we have to pay extreme attention to this because that's going to be the way

the shape of the societies to come. And now the question is um I'm really amazed by this event by the way. Right? So why India? Why now? And I think there are three main reasons if you look at this.

So first of all the sheer size of this country, right? In terms of population, but there's also consumption of digital services. And let's remember one thing. Artificial intelligence is predicated on

two factors. It's predicated on data. It's predicated on talent. And you have both an extreme scale. It's just a matter of facts. The second one is infrastructure. So you managed to solve

some of the hardest problems that every other country in the world has, right? So you managed to solve identity, payment, interoperability of data with government services. So you have an

extreme advantage. But also the third one is necessity. So AI per se is neutral. In fact, it's not. It's an unequalizer. If we do not do it well, it's an unequalizer. Makes a difference

for those that can do it well, those that can't, right? those that go faster, those that goes slower and it challenges everything, healthcare, agriculture productivity and

so on. So we need to have solutions that work for everybody which is what produces essential AI not technology AI that makes a difference and I think that you are working on that direction. So

that's something that we all are going to learn. So we are proud investors in this Indian ecosystem. Um we have invested in many companies payu Misho Swiggy. So we are investing in many of

the native companies of India but we do it because of many reasons and and that the main one is that in the past we used to go and check and learn from in from US and from China. Now we come to learn

here there's a degree of experimentation and speed. It is true. It is actually true. a degree of experimentation of speed and speed that sets the example for everybody else. So I'd like to

express our gratitude to the government of India. I we are deeply honored for the partnership with the minister for electronics and information technology,

the India mission and the various co-chairs. Thank you for the partnership. You are setting an example. We are looking forward to continue working together and building together.
