## 📝 Transcript

Okay, I'll take this question. Yeah, sure. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh so uh I mean the short answer would be that uh you know we are not there yet but a longer and more

pertinent question is that do we plan because when we say that we want to democratize something what are the main pillars of it right so for example data access to data right is one critical

point but do we have you know you know how do we access that data I mean the previous panel has already listed how what how we are tricked into giving a data Any data that we have today, it

goes through five processes, right? Data is created. It flows which means that there is a security requirement. Then it gets processed so that you make it some some meaning out of it, right? And then

also gets stored. This is how you actually you would actually generate value out of something, right? Are there ethical ways of you know or let's say a framework to do it? As of now, I'm not

sure. It is something that probably you know we signed up for something and we just say we accept that's all and then we are giving access to all the data that we have today. So uh that is the

first step. The second part which is something which concerns you know uh or is at an intersection of what we do as a company is storing and the compute right is your data being stored in such a way

that is inaccessible to any third party right you are aware of data harvest right your almost all your data is getting harvested by bad actors and you know being in India you're at the

intersection of almost all what you call as hostile neighbors right So your data harvest is not something new. It's already getting done. You would hear so much of you know things about it. And uh

the compute part is that you know today uh you have been given just what you call as the the candies to start something new right so you can start doing something early work but how do

you get access to larger you know machines and do we have those capabilities in India? I would say that you know it's it's something that the country has to have a both short-term

and long-term plan how do we do it and then the third part which goes towards developing models and you know the marketplace I I probably marketplace is something probably not my forte but

models are very critical and as you know a tech any new technology is eventually a equalizer right quantum computing is one such technology so we have something called as you know uh larger problems

which cannot be solved using the current computing systems and that's why that people are looking at building quantum computers. So almost all your chipsets today and the transistors are already at

uh couple of nanometers anything beyond actually will not work that regular physics doesn't work. So you obviously need what you called as you know better computing. Uh that is where quantum

computers come in but they are not good for almost all kind of work. So they're good at you know solving larger problems. So that's where quantum computing gets plugged with AI which is

eventually going to give a lot of power you know in terms of processing data and I think you can look at you know what uh Nvidia is doing on quantum computers but eventually any country if it is able to

uh you know develop this technology that is something where you will become you will you actually would be calling as you know democratizing it because then you have the power the hardware with you

and that's where the buck will stop. Okay. So probably this is the initial thing. &gt;&gt; So anime I was expecting quantum computing to come in the specialized

hardware. Yes. Uh Sui you &gt;&gt; thank you. Um I think we couldn't have found a better lever a better pillar to start this conversation. So overall let's look at the context. We're hosting

the India summit in India and that's one of the first large conversations that we're doing in the global south. Uh why is this important? So we need to understand the difference between

telecom and internet. So when it comes to telecom we've had four national telecom policies. Telecom works as a licency licenser arrangement. When in 2014 roughly you had about 220 million

mobile phones. Now you're sitting on 700 mobile phones. the cost of data was very very high and it's really important to not just understand we often discuss compute because it's the most obvious

aspect when a country decides to regulate supplies and creates quotas then you see it you feel it and then you've got the India mission which is saying that for the first time at 280

rupees an hour I'm making GPUs available to startups so about 38,000 GPUs were procured but that's where the conversation only starts the journey When it comes to the internet and there

are seven layers of the internet, right? We only see content. We see use cases. The conversation where Europe often tends to fix their air conditioning. We start talking about putting the roof

over our heads. So we have to first talk about access. We have to talk about critical infrastructure resources. We also need to bring back conversations around root servers in the room. What

happens when the submarine cables get cut? And this is a very real geopolitical scenario. When it comes to AI, of course, there's compute. Then there are use cases and application.

Then there is even the question of talent. So India owns 40% of world's AI talent. The why is it that you don't have more use cases? Why do you not have more IP, more patent? Why is it that you

would still be building in the back end? That conversation is very very important. So we are talking about when you say truly democratizing AI it has to work at the level of infrastructure

which is where you have chips Nvidia AMDs of the world then it is about language models and it's not a one-sizefits-all even there so the question is can we compete with billions

of US dollars in investment what is happening with Bhar GPT at IIT Mumbai we are also talking about small language models Can we look at more local contexts? How do we make sure question

of linguistics is brought about? What is Bhashani up to nowadays? How where is it that the APKs are plugging in? Then there is the third aspect which is about apps and use cases and that's where

consumer tech attention economies get built. So we are not having enough conversation also about success stories. The first lever is who's using AI? For whom are we building AI? Are we just a

captive recipient or a consumer of AI? No longer possible. Right? So, India is also a proumer of AI. And that's where the conversation that will I only look at what's at the top, what is palpable,

the conversations which will happen in a hotel in Lutian Delhi or will we have conversations about that farmer in Korapur, Kalahandi, in Merat in Badayou who's using realtime use cases of

applications. So this is where how important is AI for your government? Do they see it as a question where it's going to make them lose or win an election? Where is it let's say the

intersection of an IM luckno with an IIT Kpur going to happen? I come from UP and I'm so glad that I'm luckno put together such a well curated panel and even at this time we've got an almost full room

which tells you about why this question is so so important. So we will have to look at every single framework. The last conversation in this thread before I yield is the question of frameworks. So

where is it that standards are being set? Okay, which okay we're we're competing for share of voice also with our neighbors ve very appropriate and such an important

question and I want to reiterate this point that that conversation may happen in villainess it may happen in Baku it may happen in a very very fancy room where you're not even present so five

different aspects to that there are organizations that set standards when it comes to the internet there's ISO which allows for community participation. Uh Ishan, I think we'll have to go and

request our neighbors to sort of lower their volume so that our our conversation can also be heard. So this is where we'll have to discuss how many Indians can be present in those rooms.

Sometimes the uh even the question who does the funding, how many people from academia are going to be present in that room. Okay. So now we've increased our own voice. Uh great. Uh this is

wonderful democratization of artificial intelligence. So in real world cases and that's is I is allows for communities multistakeholder

participation. Then there's ITU. ITU is where telecom standards are set where only multilateral conversations happen. That's where you have to advocate with your MP uh the importance that he will

lay during the time of election and where that funding will happen. Does my demographic dividend or does my core constituency whether it's MSMES whether it is that vapari mandalin chi chalk are

they going to care about this issue enough? Are you going to make enough noise about ensuring that we are not left behind in the conversations? So 2G 3G we were following up but as far as AI

is concerned because we have massive engineering talent and might we have to do this much in terms of value addition to chip but in SAT we've started looking at packaging wafers we're looking at

third or fourth generation but this conversation that this is where the might will be this is where we'll prepare the future of work this is where the future of jobs is going to get

written or um in every district in Uttar Pradesh there are 72 districts they have put up incubators and we are working not just with IIT and IM because they'll need less handholding as Inmoi where

India's first unicorn and we are so delighted that we're a the second unicorn was built in just two years this is what the phone looked like some of you were present in the previous session

each time you press the power button it serves content on the lock screen across 72 um about 550 million devices is that means phone unlock they can consume content

across 18 categories. That's science and technology 101. Yes, we're using artificial intelligence and we're ensuring that content delivery is happening so that they're able to be

clued in. The third app is called Glance AI. In just one selfie, it'll generate 18 looks for you. That's downloadable and that is disrupting how marketplaces are being made. Commerce is being

written. We've connected 450 new suppliers. They can ship world over it. It's your personal stylist and that's where we're saying fashion commerce is inclusive. It's

aspirational. So a lot is happening in India. We need to discover that. We need to take pride in that. And this democratization needs to be seen as a flywheel model. Not just chip but

framing, setting standards, making sure you're part of the discourse. And that's what that's why this summit truly matters. &gt;&gt; Agreed.

So I heard proumer and I heard government losing election over AI. So if that is what it make the difference. So if it is meing and if it is government is losing election that is

where AI is making the impact. And then I heard IM and I getting clubed together and that's very interesting. Uh at IM Lucknau we have an AI lab. So that was like uh eight years back it was set up

and at that time the question was why an AI lab in IM it should be in IIT and that is where AI enabled or tech enabled businesses thought was produced and it was great at that time the leadership at

that time they thought about it and they actually have an incubator center where they talk about AI or tech enabled startups. So yep very interesting. My take on this is uh if you look at it uh

what we are looking at is is AI available to everyone is a new entrepreneur can they actually start an AI business and do they have sufficient um information or sufficient models? I

mean today we know you can get all kind of AI models available all large language models are available um which is like open sourced but is that only the thing now when we started our

journey when we were doing the PC's that is what it looked like but when we started scaling and we realized that no that is not the only thing compute and then the data are the other two

challenges and then the third challenge which is not coming out very clearly clearly by anyone here um and we are not talking about is the operationalization of it. If you're getting millions of

data point and you are working on it, how you're going to take care of it. So you have to have an operational excellence in that direction. So these are my take let's go ahead and work a

little on the access to compute. So what is the biggest barrier to accessing sufficient compute if I put that question to the panelist? So Amit maybe um I mean I also started

my journey about eight years ago okay 8 n years ago I see that you know there are a lot of things probably you know entrepreneurs can take it today which was not available let's say a decade ago

so let's say you want to run a startup you need lot of other things also not only the tech right in that way you know you have sufficient access at least getting the basic things for you. So you

have I mean there's not much of a compute in that sense but let's say you want to develop some early models uh and you want to do some PC's that we believe is broadly available at least as far as

you know you're looking at classical computers in traditional computers in place but when we look at more refined and more sophisticated models that is where you actually end up being paying a

premium that's where actually having you know associated with some of the most uh reputed labs or let's say you know startup incub incubators is going to be helpful because uh eventually everything

will boil down to how fast how good how accurate you can process something and where does all of this actually come from. So I have in we do something also called neural networks but kind of a

bridge between quantum computers but the access to computing uh especially quantum computing is not very easy. you get only very couple of bits just to try something out but otherwise you end up

paying premium. Now in the recent past we have seen uh what happens you know we have we have seen it ourselves right that a president can be taken out right what doesn't it give you a threat that

imagine that in today's time you know laws don't are not applicable to the weaker ones I mean to the powerful ones right so the powerful one can exercise their their whatever they want to do

think about the times when you know we are not the ones who are holding this comput this power the hardware the entire infra if we are not the ones who are holding it what does where does it

leave us so there there won't be any what you call as a east India company coming again because we'll obviously become digital colonies if we don't take care of the data so that is something I

definitely feel that it's very important that you know where the policy actually comes in a because policies without the policy as to who is the actual owner and that cannot be decided 10 years from now

right? Uh that's where the data has to be safeguarded. So let's say something which is still kind of very open is about how DPDP actually you know works in the case of you know AI. I mean there

is something very not clear at least we have seen some some some discussions but there's not much as to how my personal data is getting uh you know used in terms of the compute part I um I had

mentioned that you know that um even in compute we are not building those as of now we are we so there is a there is a semiconductor mission and there lot of work is happening but we are not there

yet so that actually definitely puts a it's a very important that we have our long-term plan, midterm plan clearly charted out because 10 years down the line all of these you will not have the

time to go back and rework on the on your drawing board right so you have to start now that okay you are actually in a moving train so of course you have to use AI of course you have to do whatever

that is required and you can't be untouched by it but then you have your pol you have your planning you have your strategy right as to how do you want to go in the next five years how do I have

so of course you know when the policy comes in the innovation will will actually come down but then actually that has to do more with the ethical practices establishing law around it.

How do you actually enable access as well right to the data so like for example if you want to do you can use homorphic encryption to process data that actually is one of the ways where

people are working on without understanding the whole context if encrypted data can be used to develop models that is something very important. uh looking at uh the third part which is

the developing newer technologies which will augment AI. So you we talked about you know uh quantum for AI but there's also a AI for quantum which is that you can accelerate the development in many

other fields. I think it is the only time now when you can think truly you know out of the box. You I mean almost all fundamentals of maths and physics comes into picture because apart from

that everything else is taken care right. So if you look at the the more the principal fields will become more relevant and AI can be used to develop technologies which will eventually

empower you right whether it is in terms of compute or whether it is terms of storage or you know we can talk about other applications of you know AI plus quantum put together and that actually

is very relevant for a country like us because today we cannot be ignored. I think that is this this is something that uh our prime minister has uh enabled that today we are the largest

you know players in the consumption but now how do we also and you know what she mentioned about proumers but we definitely feel that you know it is the time that we slowly shift and that is

something if you can see we have parallels you can look at look at China how they were actually the you know the ones who were only taking building doing the service part but then also building

products but it's a long-term journey and I think that is very much achievable uh one question probably I would want probably from my side is that how does an OpenStack part like in the case of

you know finance and the payments we had that OpenStack how will that actually capture because in the open stack you had only to processing but here is also about uh capturing something processing

it's more complicated than probably just doing a transactional part right how does that work so &gt;&gt; sure we'll come to that &gt;&gt; thank you I think everything that had to

be said has been said. Um I'll just add a couple of more threads. I don't see compute as a problem in isolation. I think we have to see compute as the infrastructure layer. So when you talk

about AI, when you talk to CTO's and CESOS largely, you have to see it as an AI stack. So how you would deal with technology and deployment and therefore of course the cost becomes a barrier.

It's easier said than done. uh the larger companies, legacy companies can make that kind of an investment. So we've been making a very very strong proponent to the idea that gird needs to

go up from 3 to 1% of our GDP if not 2% if not 3%. We have to ensure who's going to see it's very um very very easy to understand in any large scale technology deployment adoption the entry barrier is

always going to be the highest for startups it'll be the highest for academia and that is where uh and this is a very unique contradiction because that's startups are nimblefooted

startups is is the space and the ecosystem where innovation is going to happen where disruption is going to happen but who nor norm Normally out of the ambit it is the same people because

there this is imagine you've got a young IID Kpur grad in his second year or third year coming out with a brilliant product idea but that's what he's going to focus on. So this is where

conversations this is where you look at a Y combinator kind of an ecosystem you look at handholding you look at mentorship you look at networking and you also look at a vwork/model

of aworked compute architecture so not only does it have to be in a data center which is accessible they're saying you know if Muhammad will not come to the mountain can we get the mountain to move

how do we make sure that you look at government as an interlock, government as a priority agency that starts thinking like a CTO that starts thinking like a CEO. So UP is making an attempt

for the first time to create the first AI city and when this conversation started we started talking about don't just see it as giving very large beautiful pieces of land at subsidized

rate and Andra's also done that right they gave you land at one rupee but then what is equally important is an innovation cluster based approach will you create sharable resources of compute

can governments at scale do the procurement and ensure that sustainable architectures are made available which are consistently available. I I don't want the startup founder and being an

entrepreneur I've often said is a very very lonely journey. So I have huge respect for anybody who decides to make that journey. Um you have to first look for a good co-founder. You also have to

advocate for yourself constantly and it's not going to happen in one day because you are competing with good clean food. you are competing with basic amenities and the uh the stakeholders

that any government I'm not talking about us ours I will talk about prioritization so that's why when you look at nuclear deterrence it gets disproportionate amount of attention so

what we've been arguing all along is we've been arguing for upskilling teachers and professors and startup founders to advocate for themselves that is why ensuring ing when budget

documents and drafts are being written that IM's also speak to not just their education committees at a fiki or a CI or industry bodies and associations. Remember it's in October and September

that inputs start getting collected saying what is it that you would want your ideal budget to look like. That is where interventions have to be made saying you know I I don't want to use

that term and it's very infamous. cloud AI power. With that balance, if we can look at the importance and the attention that this issue needs, it's as urgent as your

house being on fire. And I do not exaggerate when I say that. So data centers have to be stable. They have to be accessible. The ideal word would be, for the lack of a better example, is

McDonaldization of data centers. Can you make it as accessible? It's the last thing that I want our founders to worry about, our researchers to worry about. And when you're looking at an innovation

first mindset, startup capital, we've also created a lot of unicorns. We've made sure we've done things right. So infrastructure and compute seen as that layer where the amount of emphasis that

you would pay on creating great highways and roads is the amount of emphasis that we need to start paying as far as compute is concerned and that's where negotiations are going to happen because

you have to have something that you will give so that you can get this when kotaas get drafted you have to be at an equal footage an almost equitable footage to be able to negotiate that

position that you will get access to compute. So um when global negotiations are taking place and you're discussing with the USR and you're discussing large trade treaties, this is where you need

to make sure that you put this conversation front and center and not at the periphery. &gt;&gt; Right? So I'll put up a a view here. Um think of it, we have large language

models. We have open- source model available. You also have compute access. Of course, it comes at a cost, but you have compute access. So, what you're doing, you're

building your own application using uh open models and you're running on compute. So, essentially open model is free, compute is costing and you are earning some money. So, what is

happening? You are earning 100 rupees. You're giving 70 to compute 10 to maybe having that uh model run as the way you what you are earning 20 you are getting marginalized.

Now this is how and this is what everyone want us to think make more data centers but who is whose chip is getting in Nvidia right every data center has Nvidia

Nvidia is trillion dollar tomorrow it will be three is there a new AI accelerator is there a new chip which is actually making things different as a founder or

as a startup do I have a option to collaborate ate with another startup maybe quantum compute to work on that piece of hardware which I can run that model on that hardware. So I need to

know that model too. So this is more like a chase game. uh I provide you a model, I provide you a compute, you actually take it, pay me, you earn something, you become an AI

definitive startup, but you are not, you're actually in a loop. So you have to own your own AI stack. So if you don't, I mean, you'll get a chance to talk once once we open up and

we'll do that. So that that's my my bet here. Um I I'll just take another one minute on it. Um I have seen for the compute to be provided um like IM has been providing AI lab and likewise there

are other institutes CSR funds who are actually having smaller AI labs. They are not for profit. So they are not like big uh players who are actually charging a bomb for H00s and A200s. Uh they are

only making it sure that they cover their cost. So that's one part. Um yeah so coming uh from that to the data part uh so we are talking about access to compute and access to uh data we can

rent compute but what do we do with the data so we start with you what is your thought on it &gt;&gt; thank you um so it's at the core of everything we do let's go back in time

and um the entire hype which is what one of my professors said Why is you know everybody only talking about this? This is just a large machine learning project. These are statistical

data which we have been working with. So from the 1970s the Alen Turing Institute has been working with it. What changed also needs recognition. So for the first time not just nerds, geeks and coders

but uh you know your grandmother and your chachi and your mommy and your aunt could look at the ingredients in their refrigerator and Samsung also did that and said here are five dishes that you

can make with this. They could also analyze the house plants that they were growing and they could now tell you it you are actually killing it with love. You are watering it a little too much.

It's not that your plant needs watering all the time. A lot of these made sure that AI became conversational. AI increased its user base which also means very interestingly more data sets and

you have to understand that when it comes to India we are very very unique. So for a lot of people the first time that they will go out in a month and especially women sometimes will be a

visit to a doctor. The way they will describe their symptoms will also be very unique. You know, and the doctor will then figure it out. We used to tell these jokes in the

readers digest saying the doctor it hurts here, here, here. Then he'd say you have a broken finger, right? So you would see that as a joke. But that's where contextual learning that is where

the richness of data and I go back in time again. I was um with a bank and we were working with a municipal cooperation and they were about to go bankrupt and we said would you open up

your data to us and they said madam we prefer to go bankrupt we will not give you data because that will lead to municipal bonds being created and of course we understand that but like this

summit the three pillars being people planet progress uh the moment you take away uh the process part of it and you insert technology Y some people felt that their power would go away and which

is where we wrote one of the earliest reports for matey and we talked about open data and open governance. So you may even get a data set but that data set would be scrubbed clean. So very

very important at every school with every parent with every teacher with every official that we meet and it could be any official any ministry this urgency that you need a behavior change

conversation mask you would see in co you would see a mask at your chin and very very it took a lot of effort to tell people that it would be here it would be here it would

be here mask but So you have to understand it's not just data it's the kind of data it's the format in which it is being given is it pre-processed data is it raw data is it

usable data is it data that you can do anything with this conversation that you have to treat it and I disagree with anybody who calls it oil I think data is even more precious than oil is limited

you'll put it in a barrel there's very little things that you can do with it it's it's expendable the more that you torture data, the more that you investigate data, the the newer products

will be created. But it has to be like the internet, it has to be interoperable. You need to be able to access it. And that's where we call for a national movement. We call for

sensitization much like the pulse polio campaign, much like the service that this data is precious. So the second question that we get is how should they price data?

You can keep that data with you. You can hold on tight but it's it's an idea that's no good because it's not ever going to see the light of day. So then what do we need to do and that's a great

segue into the next probably leg of this discussion which is the role of policy makers. This is where building capacity this is where telling people and understanding in every conversation

what's in it for them what's in it for you. How do you make sure that you find a global problem? You put a solution in the middle of it. You put the idea that this will help them build their legacy.

So then you get an AI data coach that's valuable. Then you get data sets that are being available. about 13,000 data sets have already been made available. Then we have to understand like the US

creates trusted corridors for their manufacturing channels that if this is coming from country A or a certain vetted party if it meets parameters it will only then be part of my supply

chain because data poisoning is also very real. Data sets are visiated uh models and large language models are hallucinating. You you see that as a joke today right? There are these reels

where they'll say, "Here is a cup, but it's closed from the top. How do I still drink water?" And the models don't know what to do with it. They're being able to see the image. They say it's a fancy

or a party trick cup. So that's where common intelligence, that's where the natural language processing aspects come in. So don't attach too much value to data. We have to become a data

intelligent nation. How do we do that? By making sure that sunlight becomes the best disinfectant. By not asking for just black boxes. By ensuring proliferation by ensuring that you

create an ecosystem that works with startup founders that works with creating regulatory sandboxes where in a trusted environment with labs with that vetting process you are able to access

and build upon that data. So the last example that I wanted to leave you with was co during the peak of COVID you had to give give up your privacy and you had to mark your location and say I may have

temperature which may be this high and that helped save lives that helped isolate people with comorbidities. So this is where understanding what is the tradeoff and understanding that as an

institutional mindset we have to put that framework together at a mahanagar palika at a panchayat level at a taluk level that's where you'll get the richest data right so decisioning

solutions and very rich um you know ideas and products at population scale can be created provided you're liberating that data Any wish &gt;&gt; still

&gt;&gt; still want me to add something on top of it? &gt;&gt; No, I don't. [laughter] &gt;&gt; It's so it was very nice listening to you. So I I have almost forgotten the

question probably. [laughter] &gt;&gt; So the question is uh how do you see data? &gt;&gt; The live question. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yes. So probably just a couple of

points. See uh uh if you want some comparison you can think of you know the AI the the algorithm or the m model right like a tiger and the data is more like you know the other animals in the

forest right so what happens is that the more this hunting will happen the digestion will happen okay the essential data that is there okay and the and the land of the tiger eventually becomes

more powerful. To what extent actually we want this uh you know lion to be powerful is a question that whether it should come and come back to us.

&gt;&gt; Very well said. &gt;&gt; Right. So that's that's probably that you know where we are like lot of digestion is already in process and as digestion happen you know you know it'll

eventually become more and more better but eventually we are the ones who are going to face it and of course in the times of usability and the risk right so let's say you know some or the or the I

would say the downside like let's something it could be let's say privacy right so something which is more usable has to be the privacy will go down Right. And then something which is very

very I mean you there's so much confidential data with which is which is there but then usability becomes low. So what is that soft spot which is maximizing these two is where actually

it cannot be done just by one individual but the policy makers have to define that let's say some genetic data can it be made available to all the market like you know market players do we have a

mechanism to stop that no idea I'm just it is probably you know I'm probably as clueless as you guys are but I feel that it is important to start the dialogue which talks about uh What

kind of data needs special you know approval? What kind of data cannot just be available to the public because the number of bad actors have always been more in the society you know for ages.

It's not today. It's not not that only today it is like that. But as technology grew, for example, anybody who controlled land ran the territory. Anybody later on it became the

waterways. Then you have what you call is that anybody who has better missiles, air, anybody who controls air is the powerful one. Right now we are going towards space and we're coming to data

and AI and then you have quantum. I'm saying that you know all of these things are becoming more and more powerful and it is important that you do not say that okay no no we don't want to be powerful

because if you say that then you you won't you will probably end up having the fate of of the president right who has just been captured. So my point is that you will have to have that thing in

hand. What is the best way is something you know it needs more nuanced discussion probably not for this but it's a food for thought like how how do you want the land stronger to be how how

stronger you want it to be &gt;&gt; right thank you good thoughts &gt;&gt; u so u uh &gt;&gt; with your permission

&gt;&gt; uh so I I I would say can we um let me conclude on it and then we kind of take the question because we are just having seven minutes &gt;&gt; just 30 seconds okay Um you know asked

me this is my Santa wish list. That's where so you have to keep knocking. This is the conversation that we really wanted

to have because I wear the policy hat. I'm I'm in public policy. I believe public policy has to be after public consultation and in public interest. So with this budget we showed the intent

that we're giving tax holidays till uh 2047 for infrastructure for data centers. My only ask would be we need to add a little more in terms of incentives. We want to make sure that we

balance this with not just foreign players but Indian companies have to also grow so that the data sovereignity conversation and atma bharta is nicely balanced because when the prime minister

says $6.3 trillion economy you need at least 100 champions to be built in India so that sunset clauses and incentivization coupled with tax holidays coupled with a global attention

which goes all the way from the metros to every single tier 2, tier three city that this matters and this is equally yours and not just some esoteric plan that's being made in Delhi. That's all

that I wanted to add. Thank you. &gt;&gt; So now looking at the data, there are three aspect to it. We say data should be made available. What about the privacy?

Do we want every startup to have access to all the private data? What about competitive edge? A company who is producing something and it is creating data. Data creation or getting data into

a proper shape require effort. So that's the competitive advantage. What about that? Now there is a third aspect which we can think more from the point of view that is government data. The data which

we all are producing something can be taken as a national resource. Something which is scrubbed and made available for people. But then even if you provide data what's happening u is that going to

create a value for a enterprise uh entrepreneur or a startup will they be able to use that data because that's available to everyone. So either you are building something on top of it

otherwise these are the three aspect which has to be very well dealt with before you. So data is not like compute where it could be made available you can waste it but with data you can actually

create weapons or you can create personalized attack which is unwanted. So of course that is where the policies and other thing comes into picture. Now uh I have four minutes and I want to

open it to the Yep. So I I know you people are excited about it. So yep, go ahead. &gt;&gt; Hi, this is Anan Gunani from Bammer and uh my question uh there's a couple of

thoughts and questions here. One is when you said about data. Now say for example when you talk about intellectual property somebody makes a song this DRM embedded and it monetizes IPRS fetches

the like royalties and shares it. Right now if my data about any parameter related to me is in a 100 different or maybe a thousand

different databases thanks to cookies which we always accept all and many other things. Why shouldn't I be making royalty out of my data and how should we not actually

make a policy and framework where my data earns money for me right? So that's the thought to that and second is about deep technology. You spoke about quantum but uh being the use

case capital of the world being a proumer using everybody's uh great technology for us to create use cases is at the business layer and we are doing things on semiconductors of course but

on overall deep tech from a policy or from a provisioning or from incentivizing what's going on. &gt;&gt; Okay. Sure. See, I mean, I started with the the first point was the data, right?

So, as of now, I think that, you know, it's it's it's very unclear that who actually will be able to monetize this data because you're using any particular software, any license agreement that you

get into, you eventually give up that right. Okay. I mean it's it's it comes it'll come to the very ethical part of it because you know you will eventually want to say I have given this data I

have yes it's my data I have trained it right but then you are the one who has also signed up for the data to be used right so I mean I I I &gt;&gt; which you don't see

&gt;&gt; which you have not seen &gt;&gt; terms that you always have to register for a new &gt;&gt; what I'm saying is yes yes what I'm saying is that now probably you are you

can probably put uh you know you can try to probably put regulations you can try to see that how it is best for both the parties 10 15 years down the line you don't even have that option right so

tying a news around this is important not only for uh you know um just an individual but at a country level as well right you know how can you know how will the sovereignty be protected

because that eventually boils to there at least two that's what I'm that's what I'm that's why I'm telling that right &gt;&gt; I just wanted to add one short point so

I started with telecom versus the internet and this debate also was raging when net neutrality came in and we said uh should internet be treated like a utility should it be treated like water

as a resource this is where it's very important to understand in 2016 we were faced with call drops and there was a demand for investment in the telecom infrastructure right and then OTTs came

in it's very very important to understand that there is an ROI involved and that's the trade-off that if you want somebody to invest this is very very expensive infrastructure so when

you're doing the consent layer what the DPDP has done now it allows you to withdraw consent and it ensures that every single time an app is using your data and if they change the purpose for

which it is going going to be used. Okay, data has to be treated differently when it is at rest, when it is in transit, where it's going to be stored. It's taken us almost 15 years to get to

this stage right from the first draft. So, always remember that somebody's paying for and this is the trade-off between convenience. This is the trade-off between innovation and this is

the trade-off between what is being built on top of that layer. Is very very important and who's paying for that is equally important. So advertising in a way subsidizes a lot of

things. That's why it's very important when there's a sluggish economy the spends and money in circulation remains because somebody's paying for it. &gt;&gt; All right. So um just to conclude on

that and maybe if there is another question u yeah okay so we'll come to that now that is where uh we have been given lot of reasons why the data will be used right it is my data as you

rightly said it's my data I may sit with it and I may make no use of it but I don't wish to disclose like in the earlier session there was a discussion Dathlon says you have to have your phone

number otherwise I'll not bill you why I don't want to give you my phone number and that's it. So even if I want to use my phone and in my phone it hears things I'm talking about data I'll see some

data center coming in. So I have to have right where I should stop these things. So again we are coming from democratizing to a different part al together but nevertheless uh that's an

important piece. Yeah, last question if we think so like I can talk in Hindi. Okay. Uh, Gmail, Hotmail.

Mail policies data center power could manage

patent database. Okay. So if you can sorry cut we can do that discussion maybe outside. If you have a question please go ahead. I have to stop you. I have a question

please. Thank you. Thank you so much for that. &gt;&gt; We are too pleased to address your question. Okay. I can but I would I you know one point

&gt;&gt; thank you. Thank you everyone and I would like &gt;&gt; thank you. Uh so uh once again round of applause for the p amazing panel which we have

&gt;&gt; for &gt;&gt; and for the moderator as well. And now just before we uh proceed to the momento presentation uh thank you audience for coming from almost all the diverse

backgrounds from public sector industry academy. We are really happy to have you and uh so I'll quickly brief you about uh not not too much of a presentation but a just quick view what actually IM

lucknau enterprise incubation is there. So the first thing which comes in the mind is IM luck now has two campuses. So yes I am lucknau has uh two campuses one in na one in Lucknau and it has been uh

you know uh collaborating at at best best international and national level. This is our structure and uh with my colleague Nikil Bhatt we also if you have any queries related to blockchain

technology you can always reach out because we are also setting up a center for blockchain excellence with in collaboration with government of UP. EIC has already been collaborating with

various public sector uh institutes and organizations and to together we are creating this impact in the AI ecosystem. So uh first now uh I I'll request Amit Shivas sir to present a

momentto of gratitude to the speakers request to present to anime G also. And now I uh request Vinit Kumar Pruti sir who is the director uh IT at National Informatics Center to please facilitate

our uh moderator. So NIC team has been our spark and coordination co in in tandem we have made this panel discussion successful. Uh so uh you know thank you so much we can join for a uh

you know a group photograph please we have professor saty bushandas from I am luckno sir if you can please come on the stage for a group photograph and fellow participants if you wish to please join.

Let's come. electronics and IT Vishek Singh sir and all our esteemed panel uh some of the speakers were unable to join but really thank you so much for uh for joining in

all all the participants who have come from different part of the world uh we have good representation from India and other countries also I would like to Thank all the uh IM Lucknau Enterprise

Incubation Center our leadership my colleagues and Nikl G who have provided their support and thank you audience. Thank you so much. Thank you.
