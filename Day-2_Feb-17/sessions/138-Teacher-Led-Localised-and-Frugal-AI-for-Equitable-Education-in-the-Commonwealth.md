## 📝 Transcript

universities and colleges. Professor Ami Upadia has served as vice chancellor of BAOU Gujarat since 2018. India's open universities reach beyond the conventional to open access to all

with innovative teaching and learning. Dr. Sumit Kalra is associate professor at the department of computer science and engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology in Jodpur. Bringing frugal

AI system innovation from India to the world. To these three voices of India, we add three international voices. Dr. Edwin Tano is the CEO of the Kenya

School of Technical and Vocational Training in Kenya. Dr. Tano plays a key role in shaping Kenya's vocational and technical education landscape from policy all of the way to implementation

in a skills agenda. Dr. Sout Rohit is the special adviser to the minister for tertiary education and research in Maitius a small island state with a highly engaged government driving

learning innovation and Dr. Rajni Chand is the director of the center for flexible learning at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji. Through that university, Dr. Chand

represents not one but a network of 12 Pacific island countries working together. My name is Peter Scott and I'm the president and CEO of an

intergovernmental organization of the Commonwealth of Nations. That is 56 sovereign countries working together. Our intergovernmental organization is tasked

with helping those countries to innovate in education to create new things that will help learners to be included in education where they cannot otherwise access it where they cannot otherwise be

successful. intent is to sustainably open up education inclusively to all and we speak through giving voice to our member nations from the smallest island state

to the largest. So without further delay, let's hear a little from each of these voices of the Commonwealth and they've all got less than five minutes now um to

tell you a little bit about the broad agenda that we are launching today with the compact for frugal AI for inclusive education. First up, I'll invite Dr. Kalera

to this to the podium. Good evening everyone. Uh I am associate I am associate professor working at IIT Jpur in computer science department and

we have been working with Commonwealth of learning to develop this frugal AI based system. So I'll talk about the system bit more. Uh why we moving to frugal AI? Uh frugal AI means we have

our AI server running in a local system. It's not on cloud. That gives some inherent advantage of offline ready. You don't need to have internet connectivity while using this frugal AI based

solutions. Then you have data sovereignity. You have full ownership of data because the data is not leaving your premises. Then it's privacy first because data is

not leaving your pre uh premises. You have full control over data. So you control your privacy as well. Since it's on a local system, local internet, you saved on bandwidth, you

save on power. Like I said, it does not require big servers, large computing resources. It can work with maybe a uh server class machine in your data center. So it's a low power, it's a low

cost as well. So when teachers and learners are locally accessing the AI server, it serves the purpose and gives all these benefits. Let's see how this system working which we have developed

with commonwealth of learning. So it's a teacher in loop process. So teacher is in loop at every stage. It's not like a chat GPT or any other tool where you just give a prompt and get the answer.

Here you uh here our models have been trained on a particular curriculum and that's where the teacher comes into loop at each and every stage and curate the content and make sure that the content

is safe for consumption by learners. Once the content is generated, it goes through the review process. Once review is done, then it get published and then you can share with other educators.

Let's look into how the system is actually working with teacher in loop. Uh our model has uh been fed with the government approved curriculums. Uh currently we have developed this system

which is being used in five countries including India, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Nigeria and we are working at the school level, college level and vocational training level. So all the

levels with different kinds of subjects like mathematics, biology, fashion technology and lab sciences. So this variety shows that this Google AI concept can be uh brought to the system

uh into AI in education with a local server running in my lab. We are not using any cloud services for that. So this uh curriculum approved uh approved government approved curriculum

is being used uh for training our LLMs and these small models have been trained for different subjects and then we have a layer of AI agents which help you devising the content or structuring the

content or verification for quality and uh alignment purposes. Once these events gives you output uh educators comes in loop at each and every phase uh you can in fact uh right

now navigate to teacher in the loop and can see how system is working. So when it when it gives you the first output then it goes through the verification immediately. It's not that

the end result will be verified. verification teacher in the loop since the beginning. So that's the overall advantage of teacher in loop. It helps reducing the

lesson preparation uh time for teachers and teacher has full control over the content what they are going to deliver to their learners. Local hosting makes it uh possible

running on institutional server. So universities do uh don't need to go out and pay heavy cloud bills. Then data uh fully controlled by your educational institutes.

There's no dependency on cloud. Data remains within your territory in your premises with full privacy and then it's global ready because we are low bandwidth. We have mobile friendly

design. it works with even uh 3G kind of uh network availability. So with that uh I'll hand over to uh professor Scott. [applause] So Dr. Kalera was very very concise.

Thank you. That was perfect. I hope the rest of the speakers have learned that perfect lesson um for us today. So what we're talking about is AI that can be distributed in a frugal way to off-grid

contexts to include remote communities. But always we're focused on the topic of quality and that brings us to professor Canabiran. Good afternoon to all of you.

So you know India has about,170 universities and 50,000 colleges and if you look at where these colleges are located more than 40% of the colleges are

located in tier 2 tier three rural remote locations hilly areas and these are the institutions where we want to sort of make them inclusive and mainstream in them. And these

institutions in rural and remote locations have as all of you know so many challenges and lack of access to public infrastructure, lack of access to high-end devices.

There are languages too many languages that our country speaks and someone was saying that there are 20 plus countries speaking one language and there is one country which speaks 22

languages. That's kind of diversity that we in. and very high faculty student ratio sort of slightly technical term the number of students were divided by the number of faculty very high ratios

and our prime minister through national education policy has brought in the very important agenda of GR to 50% by 2035 which is currently 28%. [clears throat] And there is a clear shift from

knowledge to skills. And recently we uh got the skill India report released which says that India has now 51% employability which has risen from 33% about 10 years ago 33 to 51% and there

is a large percentage of to improve. Now we are looking at um the uh frugal AI from specialization to democratization. And today if you look at we as a country

are a dichotomy and if you look at institutions of higher learning INIs or the institutions large private ones which are with resources are able to look at specialization in using AI. But

what we need is to democratize it and particularly and the topic of the day today is personalization of in learning using AI. But what we are looking at is localization of AI and what uh Smith

explained and we may look at from large language models to small language models more applicable to the ground situation and we don't need GPUs. These institutions or these communities can't

offer GPUs but you need to look at uh AI available in personal devices and proprietary to opensource technologies configurable platforms and resources so that with limited resources they will

still have access to uh specialized uh resources and obviously public private partnership and what we want to have is a student centered learning with s teacher centered technology

Thank you. &gt;&gt; Three minutes. That was that was that was amazing. 3 minutes. Um so hey, we're going to have time for questions. Who's who who knew? Um which is fantastic. So

what you've heard is two of the voices of India. Uh India's open universities are tasked with breaking open the educational system. So it's a pleasure to introduce Professor Ammy Upadia, vice

chancellor um of BAOU, Professor Peter Scott and uh co-panelists indeed pleasure and privilege to address something close to heart. Early we used to talk a lot about

student centric and today we are talking about you know after having machine we are talking about teacher in the loop system which is very very important after a

uh professor kibarin mentioned about uh the target of GR gross enrollment ratio of uh 50 per 35 here I would like to mention that in 1920 uh the Aisha report says that out of

total G 11% plus GR comes from open universities. They are state open university 17 plus national one. And now if you include in 2026 if you look at it with 100 plus higher education

institutes offering open distance learning and online obviously it would add to it. When meta comes to open here I would be sharing my experiences a little about open universities and the

problems they face and how this particular model would help us to solve those problems. First of all uh for example universities like us with uh 300,000 students YCU Maharashtra open

university and again ignore we get a huge number large number of students second variety of languages we have to invest a lot open universities will have to know we have been investing a lot on

self-arning material developing content now when it would save duplication of content also because the content what would be uploaded here would be used as OEER. So it would help us to save money

and time in duplication of the content. Second with large language model again social language model and customizing it to cultural language model that would be very very important. Third point which

is very important is that when better comes to uh faculties with lacks of students the number of faculties are comparatively very less. So continuously being in touch with all number of

students sitting at maybe the periphery of the states periphery of the nation it's not that easy. So this particular no problem would know would be solved by the solution given by common of learning

here. Next somewhere customizing and tailor my know tailoring certain courses in various languages making it more uh comfortable convenient and customized for the people here that would be very

easy. Faculties cannot do that where technology will really help us with that. National education policy focuses a lot on accessibility, affordability and inclusive education and huge focus

on use of technology. Uh that focuses on credit framework also new credit framework where again this particular solution will help us a lot. universities like us who really offer 80

plus programs and 1,000 plus courses developing course content for them that is huge time consuming and investing but here that would be solved by I think this problem so that would also help us

a lot when m comes to maintaining students uh uh motivation continuously that happens when continuously a teacher is there in the loop for the conver conversation and solving the problem yes

and again In rural uh India connectivity is a huge problem. Internet is a huge problem. In absence of internet when really the teacher is in the loop to help the problems to solve the problems

that's really very very important and the choice based credit system also skill courses vocational professional courses are mandatory. Now this particular will come up with those no

solutions also. I think when matter comes to future uh open university, open distance learning and online learning solutions more of uh assignment, question paper setting, assessment uh

continuously modification of content would really add value to AI use of AI in open distance learning and online learning. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. doing great for

time. Fantastic. So now that we've heard three critical voices from India looking at the power of India's technology to try and create things that can be deployed in a frugal

way. um the importance of the challenge of reaching out into remote communities and how we even do that with what you're going to hear in the whole rest of this summit is very clever and incredibly

expensive stuff and we've heard the task of India to try and make that work through open technologies and open systems and open education. Let's look at the rest of the world. um

and we're tasked with a small part of the rest of the world that contains um a lot of countries large and small. And I'll note that so far we've focused quite a lot on the higher education

sector. But one of the things that ministers say to us all the time and we're a diplomatic organization driven by the needs of the governments is that we need

to think about the skills agenda and how to make sure that when young people complete their education they are skilled and employable. So I'd like to call on Dr. Edwin Tano from the Kenya

Training. Thank you very much uh Professor Scott and team. uh we'll concentrate on the issues of Tibet uh technical vocational education

and training and is frugal AI good for TV because a lot of people in TVET think that uh frugal AI is too low for them and that is where we really have to

discuss. We know for sure that three items in the contemporary AI where we currently have CH GPS and the rest consume three major major components. More electricity,

more data keeping, more data computing and more water for cooling the data systems. Now if you look at all those items, they are the items that lack in third world countries. Basically, if you

accept to continue with the traditional system, then you are committing suicide. So, how do we then mitigate? It's frugal AI that will help us. It's going to make it cheap for us to operate at the same

time be able to have a localized system. Rural India is like Kenya also. We have a rural Kenya and rural Africa. So, we really need to look at that. What we are basically trying to say is we are going

to do more for less. That's the whole purpose of frugali. Getting more for less. Now I'll just work quickly and ask that if you look at that then where does the teacher come in? Who is the

technical teacher? The technical teacher is so critical in coming in because you cannot transform students without transforming the teacher. We usually say you fix the teacher, the teacher will

fix the student, the student will fix the product. So you can't work the other way around. So at Kenya School of TET working with Commonwealth of Learning, we have developed this system, a small

frugal AI system that is going to be rolled across the country. It will be interesting as we move to counter these things. But what are the processes that are critical for making a good frugal AI

for the institution? The first item you need to do is to have leadership acceptance. Whether it's the vice chancellor or a principal of that institution, they must have a buy in.

That's the first thing. The second thing is to explain of course to the stakeholders the benefits of frugal AI and how much they will save in time of time, energy and ability for you to have

the teacher to be the center of the work. The second one is to develop clear policies and this is very critical because if you develop policies then it guides you in implementation. So develop

policies and remember when you're developing policies you must have an inclusive system of policy where we have student leaders if there's possibility we have lecturers of that institution.

We have faculty heads so that the whole system can be able to agree on how to move to the next level. The third one which is usually the most difficult is to enforce.

Now we have to enforce it. We have to make it work and you can enforce this using several strategies that you can have across the systems in your institution.

Then the last one of course is the teacher. Uh how competent is the teacher in terms of developing the concepts that can be done locally and of course making them relevant to the needs of that

institution. In frugal AI, we do not have a wide system that is shared easily. We are going to develop your own work with the systems that you believe in and it can be done locally by your

lecturers and be able to be kept within the institution. That way you're going to have more for less. Thank you very much. [applause] &gt;&gt; Okay. Super.

Um so skills Kenya leadership engagement um now I want to look away from the larger countries and focus a little bit on the needs of smaller countries and

we'll start with a country at a political level. So I'd like to introduce to you the special adviser to the minister for tesery education and research of maicius Dr. Sokut Rohit.

Thank you professor Scott. Good afternoon everyone. Um let me let me let let me uh take this perspective from a policy approach. uh what is important when we are discussing about education

uh in a country in Maicius or in any other country u for policy makers what's important is to ask the simple question what is the intention in whatever we are trying to do the intention um

is very difficult to answer because very often there are different stakeholders who comes to the table with different perspective with different agenda but in the education sector at

least there is something fundamental we are trying to build a skills and competencies for the future generation so for us as policy makers what's important is to ask a few question how

do we get there and at what cost do we get there what does it take to build the capacity of our young people so that they can build the world of tomorrow now in policym making we always talk about

three E. One is equality. Equality of opportunity. Equality of uh quality opportunity for everyone wherever they are in the country urban, rural, remote, wherever they are. For us coming from um

island economies and and my colleague would co-panelist would agree there sometimes we have several islands for the same country. Now reaching all these people is important and not all of them

have the same infrastructure. Not all of them maybe they all are the same income level but not all of them have the same network, same infrastructure, same server. They are very different. The

second thing is always about efficiency. What is the best possible way to do whatever we are trying to do? And here we always talk about efficiency and effectiveness. Efficiency is doing the

right thing. uh doing things the right way. Effectiveness is doing the right thing. And that question always comes on the table. Whatever we are doing, if we are doing the right way, that's not

enough. It's doing the right thing which is more important than doing it the right way. And for us small islands, what's also important is the third E which is environment, sustainable uh

environment. So that brings me to four important questions, four important concepts that uh we always discusses before discuss before uh taking a policy measure. First is always cost.

Uh for island economies or for small countries cost is extremely extremely important. We are all in a situation where probably we are highly indeped already or we have a fiscal space which

is very very limited now and here the discussion about adopting open AI or frugal AI is very important here where is the cost lower you remember I spoke about efficiency and effectiveness are

we able to reach the same objective with a lower cost that's where for us frugal AI comes in in frugal AI you know um we we have to have less energy less cooling system etc. So my my colleagues my

companies talked about this earlier. The second thing for us is sustain sustainability and environment. Uh large language models use a lot of energy and for us that's very bad. Now we as island

economies we face severe problem of sustainability. It's even a survival problem. If the sea level rises, we are all doomed, right? The island will cease to exist. For us, that's even if we

don't contribute to uh the global uh carbon footprint so much, yet it is important for us. So, we try to to to to as much as possible to contribute to that sustainability agenda. And for us

frugal AI is very important because it lose less power, less cooling system, so less energy, less carbon footprint etc. The third is inclusivity and digital uh divide.

With in Maicius we are at a GR ratio which is above 50%. Which is very high comparatively with the rest of the world but we want to do more. For us inclusivity does not mean poor people.

It means people who may not have access to the best technology, the best network. So, how do we reach to them? How do we bring them on board? How do we um [snorts] provide systems that they

can use with their simple laptops rather than big servers using their iPhones? How my my co-pan spoke earlier about UDR. So, how do we bring them um all the training materials using a simple phone?

my is not even an iPhone right uh using simple for they can use those um uh uh uh lessons or whatever uh we produce for them and finally what's very important uh for all country I think in the era of

of geopolitics here is data sovereignty how do we make sure that the data that we are feeding the system does not go in an intended hands right we need to keep that data sovereignty as much as

possible internal or regional And that's where frugal AI help a lot because whatever we put in this in in the system remains within uh the frontiers of the country or of the institutions. So those

are the points I wanted to make uh today. Thank you very much. [applause] Thank you very much. Um so finally doing brilliantly on time um I would like to introduce a perspective from the

Pacific. Dr. Rajni Chand is the director of the center for flexible learning at the Dr. Chant good afternoon to all of you. I'm going

to take you to the south of the equator because uh we have heard from the countries that are uh I would say not sure but I would say global south and uh the center that I represent as well as

the university that I represent uh is in a crosscutting section where we have nine commonwealth countries and we have 13 small island countries that make up the

university of the South Pacific which is the I think the only second regional university in the world. So when we look at these small island countries the first thing that can come to your mind

is the smallalness. Apart from PNG Papa Newu Guinea which has more than 10 million population the other 12 island countries that make up the University of

the South Pacific none of them have more than a million population each and a few of them are just 2 m above the ocean level. Meaning in another 50 or 60 years time some of the countries

like Tuvalu or Kiribas may be under the sea level itself but that doesn't mean that their identity their knowledge their culture their tradition should be lost.

So the some of the projects through which we have actually provided them the kind of support is through the various projects we are doing with Commonwealth of Learning as

well as with the trust the these countries have with the University of the South Pacific to provide them with that uniqueness that still that proprietorship of the knowledge that

they have and that is through using the skilled training, professional development as well as trying to provide them with the AI knowledge that can be useful to them

when they have to start or to develop the resources for themselves. When we look at a million population or less than a million population, we are looking at experts in the country who

are holding or wearing multiple hats as well. You may have the same person at the ministry of education who is looking after the database. The same person may also be the focal point for commonwealth

of learning. The same person is the trainer to provide the training for the teachers in the secondary or the primary school. That one person may just have a bachelor's degree.

How will they continue to provide the support necessary? How will they develop the resources? They may have just one IT expert in their ministry level. If the computer breaks down or if one of these

persons are sick or have decided to migrate, most of these countries have only a flight once a week or every 3 weeks. And the only country they can depend on is

Fiji, which is the largest of these island countries. So the skill development, putting the data together, training everyone else is then dependent on these

people who just don't have the time and the knowledge. And that is where trying to provide the support as well as creating that trust in whoever is providing the training comes from

trustworthy organizations. And that is where Commonwealth of Learning as well as University of the South Pacific is providing the training for these island nations and Papa New

Guinea for that matter as well. so that they still have the identity when any of these AI resources are developed and that is where we are continuing our work and we will wish we will do so but

remember when we talk about global south this is the south that I'm representing thank Thank you. [applause] So today, the Commonwealth of Learning is launching a compact, which is an

agreement that we are inviting all of our stakeholders to sign up to. The compact uh indicates a number of critical elements that that you've heard from all the speakers today. Um it will

allow access to uh a team uh a community an alliance to an open framework um produced by our colleagues in India and beyond and a series of protocols about how we intend to deploy our systems.

Uh this alliance is already in existence and you've heard from a number of the stakeholders in this room of um communities in which we're already piloting frugal technologies.

So if you're in a remote location in Papa New Guinea or in one of the islands of the South Pacific, you can take a university filled with experts already on a laptop.

It already can represent actually a pretty good representation of the skills of a reasonable librarian who's got access to your library. Uh a sensible prost who can tell you a little bit

about the structure of your curriculum. uh someone who can help you to do basic advisory services without those individuals being anywhere else other than in a box and certainly not on

someone else's cloud. So affordable um sovereign private secure

and sharable but only when you choose to do that. critical parts of the compact which you will see if you go to our um website which is uh on that QR code and

we've also got a lot of cards. We've handed out a range of cards today. Please pick up a card. Please share cards with your friends. Um and if you are a Commonwealth country, which India

is, um you're already part of our community, to work with us on making learning more accessible, more flexible, more affordable, and able to reach into communities where it otherwise can't get

at a price that makes sense. So, 5 minutes and 31 seconds to go. Any questions? microphone. &gt;&gt; Hello. Am I audible?

&gt;&gt; Uh uh thanks a lot for having such a nice panel on the education side of the AI. My question is about India and about the impact of AI on primary education. on the education side and on the

non-education side of the AI in primary education because in primary education the children learns a lot other than education side in the school environment then how how will we cater to that with

the AI and all &gt;&gt; question who wants me first &gt;&gt; actually there are a lot of things happening in the uh school education front I'm not sure how many of you

attended the two-day summit on 12th 13th in the same place which was conducted by IIT Madras and Ministry of Education and there are plenty of applications and there are plenty of uh NOS's and private

entities coming together um you know to provide these opportunities and there are new platforms like Baren platforms coming up to help these initiatives I think it's it's happening much better

and much bigger in school education to respond to them. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; you got that. &gt;&gt; How can we get AI support

for to visualizing the concept of competency based learning and technology based assessment under the umbrella of the commonwealth.

&gt;&gt; Sweet competencies. That sounds like you. Edwin want to talk about competencies. Thank you. Uh the question of competencies is uh is interesting. Uh currently the Kenya School of TET is

leading the Cibet program of changing the technical teachers from the knowledgebased system to competence based educational systems. Uh we have succeeded very well in doing that. We've

trained over 10,000. But the whole reason is the aspect of competency is looking more of skills. How do you are you competent or are you just knowledgeable? We used to do what was

called ket knowledge based education and training. Now it's competence based. In other words, let me give you a critical example. If I asked you to how to make a stool in

activity institution, you can go to JPT. It will give you an answer in 10 seconds. It can even give you how to do the nailing. But you see JPT hasn't make the stool.

So what we are now telling you is we are giving you 10 marks for showing how to make a stool but we are giving you 90 marks for making this tool. So if we remain knowledge based we are actually

compromising fully in the AI systems. So you will give us how to make a stool that is five marks make the stool for me until it's standing you get 95 marks. That is the shift to competence based

where you must give a product not just knowledge. So I think the same thing will apply with mathematics which is your field of specialization. Show me what you've done not what you

know and that is the big difference. &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm told we got time for one more question even though we have a full 2 minutes. So good afternoon everyone and thank you for this insightful panel um

from Mauritius from I see that we've got one speaker from Mauritius. So my question is we've been talking about uh energy saving, we've been talking about uh affordable AI but uh what about the

quality of training because we've been talking about uh putting AI in universities. I was also a lecturer. So how do we maintain this quality training? How do we ensure that we don't

kill creative thinking and problem solving through the AI? Because today what we see from student is most of them when they get assess assessment so it's being done by chmini

or others. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Uh yeah I would like to uh uh address this. So for quality uh if you uh look at our portal which is up and running it actually is very well aligned with your

curriculum which is government approved. uh in fact uh we have experienced that people are searching outside curriculum that again with the curriculum uh based matching it's bringing that topic to

your curriculum and then explaining and explaining with the generative AI power of generative AI. So if you ask the same lesson plan again and again you will get different answers but again every answer

will be related to your curriculum model with well alignment. So we are by design we are with quality. We are not compromising quality if we are going for frugal. That is the first condition we

should be careful about. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh we're out of time. Um but I'm really grateful to my team for doing a fantastic job of covering so much ground in a very short period of time. Uh

please feel free to visit our website if you haven't picked up a card. Um please do so. And uh thank you very much today. &gt;&gt; Hi Chicago.

Um I have like a very basic question because I didn't want to bother with this but when we're talking about AI and um models that can run on mult &gt;&gt; so using are we using models

&gt;&gt; okay so running on local &gt;&gt; deepse so anything that's open source we will work with and there's a whole bunch of new models that are open source We ran

50 models because each subject requires different groups to answer your outer we are addressing these four subjects. &gt;&gt; Okay. Holland has done locally that

online. &gt;&gt; Yeah, everything open. We're doing an aentic framework at the moment to try and make sure the right question. So the aentic

having &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. So this is a model.
