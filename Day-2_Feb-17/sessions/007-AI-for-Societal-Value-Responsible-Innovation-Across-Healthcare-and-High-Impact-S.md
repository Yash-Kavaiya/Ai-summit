## 📝 Transcript

Institute a learning voice in precision cancer treatment and advanced radiotherapy. Dr. Kiran D. Seeker, founder and medical director of Kiran Infertility Center, a

pioneer in reproducive medicine and infertility care. And Professor Dilip K. Prasad from UIT the Arctic University of Norway will be the moderating today's

discussion. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me to welcome our esteemed presenters and panelists in the stage. Thank you Dr. Arif for a very nice

introduction and uh I welcome Dr. Tano, Dr. Swarupa and Dr. Kiran for coming for this panel discussion uh with me. We are into the AI domain and this AI impact is uh going to be a big event. So our

discussion point is AI for societal value and so I will start with the first question uh and uh so the question is like you know we I work in the research and academia and now research is going

into the actual industry and clinical practices. How this is impacting your Dr. Tanuji in cardiology. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. So I we've seen the advent of AI into the medical practice

and especially in cardiology. I think it has had a role ever since uh the start of this century. Early in 2000 we started uh idealizing u um identifying ECGs for early

predictors of ST elevation especially in acute MI situations acute mocardial infection situations. There are situations where time is very very par of paramount importance in managing the

patients and AI can has gone and it will go further ahead in reducing that delay. So it's not just the intelligence that which matters but how intelligently and how swiftly we are able to identify it

and it has gone a long long way especially in cardiology. It has moved from a reactive specialtity to a preventive specialty with the use of AI. So rather than treating myioardial

inffections and already diseased patients, I think so AI can become a get a paradigm shift, it can shift the treatment from treatment to prevention. So we can predict a MI. In fact, there

are various beautiful protocols, AI protocols where where we are able to predict the chances of a death event that is occurring. So preventing a death I think so this is the most wonderful

innovation that we can welcome from the field of AI especially in cardiology and it's not just that means it's not seemingly stopping here it is moving uh deeper and deeper into cardiology. So in

our very very super speciality there's a imaging modality known as OCT that's optical corance tomography and AI has actually entered that field and we are able to exactly define the lumen so this

OC by St. Judes or Abbott we are able to identify the lumen and we are able to size our stances we are able to size our devices we can treat tailor our therapy and it this is known as uh something

which we called as mechanistic approach to coronary syndromes so we are able to understand the mechanism only and only because of AI because it's giving us not just that power it is giving us that

speed it is it just does not fatigue like us humans it just continues to work and I think so there are various other innovations also another beautiful thing is penumbra so it is a device which is

computer resisted vacuum throbeci so it gives us audiovisisual cues which were dependent on the operator till now means if I am pretty fatigued then I'm able to miss it but if I have a auditory stimuli

if I have a visual stimuli and which is guided by AI which actually dictates me okay stop now okay go ahead now I think so this is these are some of the few innovations which come to my mind

&gt;&gt; so that is wonderful you Dr. Good morning everyone. I'm so thankful for this privilege and uh yeah I think AI uh I would say AI has been in

oncology even before the a we were aware of this word a AI. So AI means making things easy and for cancer this is very very important. So it helps AI has helped in every aspect of cancer

treatment right from prevention. So there are AI tools which help cancer to be detected early not only in the hospitals even at home and even in remote places. Most important is the

diagnosis an accurate diagnosis. A cancer treatment cannot begin without a proper diagnosis. So an accurate diagnosis that too quick. The time is very important because cancer is time

dependent. The earlier the quicker the diagnosis is made the quicker the treatment is started and a patient can be treated in the first or second stage itself when he has presented. Another

thing which is very important which has come up right now is the personalization of treatment. So for example a breast cancer patient second stage suppose there are four breast cancer patients of

second stage not everyone will have the same treatment. Every cancer patient has a treatment which is tailored to her genomics, her biology, her electronic records and her images pathology. So it

involves a lot of things where we can personalize the treatment. The treatment delivery becomes quicker. So uh surgery which would take about 7 hours, 8 hours, it can be quicker. A radiation oncology.

So radiation oncology means it has to be a targeted treatment that is treat the cancer cells only and not the normal cells. So that can be done beautifully with the help of AI and radiation

oncology and radiology have been using AI like I said much before the word was coined. The toxicity and the outcome that cano be predicted with the help of AI. So

which person has is more prone to toxicities that can be predicted and proper steps can be taken even before the treatment is started. Most importantly the uh help of AI is in the

patient management. The huge number of patients we see in the OPD, the long waiting cues, the long hours for getting up, all these things are managed very beautifully and we can use these

resources for other more productive work. Thank you. &gt;&gt; That is a very wonderful uh explanation. How about you Dr. Kiran in the reproductive?

Yeah, in our reproductive science also AI has come up in a very big way. uh actually earlier I we used to think that it's just an innovation and you know one of the modern things which will come and

go but it's come here to stay actually in our field itself and uh all the basic uh tests which we do even AI is playing a very important role there also right from the time when the patient talks to

her to to us from her house also she's actually we can give her some AI tools to actually give her history to track her ovulation so right from that uh starting phase of the ovulation to

finally putting the embryo inside the uterine cavity. So I'll just enumerate very very shortly what where it helps us. It helps us to actually tailor our ovulation induction regimes to the

particularly that particular person. So earlier we used to give the same dose to everyone but now AI helps us depending on her hormonal status on her age group on the number of eggs she has that how

much dose has to be given. So there we have become very very precise. So instead of you know like generalizing the thing we have become very precise. So naturally that will give us more eggs

to actually work on and uh in turn finally it will improve our pregnancy rate. Now comes the second phase where it helps us is you know where we take out the eggs and then start giving it to

the embryologist. The embryologist will tell that you know how many eggs are mature. So this was his subjective assessment. Now we have an objective assessment in the form of the AI coming

to help us whether these uh usites are mature or not whether they are you know immature oides which cannot be used for the EXC procedure we cannot inject the sperm inside the egg if it is not a

mature egg so there it is helping us a lot and uh the you know the rate at which it tells us is also very high like 97%. There again it tells us where the polar

body is. There is one body where the reduction division has taken place in the egg and uh where we have to actually inject the sperm. It tells us the very precise exact point. So there again we

are you know like a state-of-the-art technology where it is going to improve our results. Then finally when we come to the embryo uh culture finally when we come to the next day

where the pr-uclei are formed and fertilization has take taken place it tells us whether fertilization is good or not whether two two pruclei are formed or not. So there again lot of uh

you know our work is very eased out. Then we never used to take out the embryos very very you know quickly and at regular intervals because that spoils the embryo quality when you're taking

them out of the incubator. But now we have uh AI backed tools which will be which are called as embryoscopes and uh which tell us the timelapse imaging of the embryos. So as the embryo

divides every 10 minutes it takes a picture. So it's humanly impossible to go inside the incubator and take that picture. The embryologist will take it out only once in two days. But here it

is doing it for us every 10 minutes. And finally all that five days when we grow the embryo, it is going to give us a video of that. So many pictures you know and there the AI tool in our lab itself

we learn from that because uh you know data is also very important. So like whatever we imagine and did not imagine also is happening. Finally which embryo to put inside the uterus. See there is a

big you know like uh something called as you know embryos are put on the slide and then he says this one madam that one which one should be put like so it's again a subjective assessment but here

AI is able to give us with a correct information about these embryos that 97% uh efficacy of correct uh saying you know all look look similar so it's like a beauty pageant everybody is going

around and you know like you say which one is the best among them. So finally that also is decided by that but I don't know how far but you'll be asking those questions again maybe so we'll answer

that. &gt;&gt; So that is wonderful we are here the one who is producing the future life the one who is maintaining the life and preventing the life and one who is

saving people. So I come back to you Dr. Tanoj like you know the uh cardiology is very very uh preventive or you were saying that we are moving towards the prevention side. So uh in your aspect

you know the AI is impacting the thing how ready AI is is to do the realtime cardiac care. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh so I think means I just mentioned that we have a lot of tools in

the armamentarium means if I talk about cross specialty since ma'am is sitting about oncology we have uh echoc cardiography a very basic investigation but all said and done in the past just

around a decade back a good echo cardiogram used to take around 30 minutes another 10 minutes or its interpretation and welcome AI now we are able to do it in a snap of 13 to 15

seconds. So you take an image, the AI is able to predict things and since I was talking about cross specialty like oncology. So uh cancer chemotherapy may have adverse outcomes on the heart the

LV the left ventricle the cardiac function gradually decreases with certain chemotherapeutics. So we used to get know this earlier after the entire heart has been damaged

in uh simple terms but now we have special strain analysis. We have speckled track tracking analysis which is done within seconds and it may help us with the health care professional who

sitting out sitting in the uh third tier hospital and it can be uh detected about uh clinical it can be uh treated and the diagnosis. So what happens? We have seen this so much in our practice. A person

who is in the remote areas has been suffering from some symptoms which has not could not have been detected cannot be detected there. So again once again so there are platforms. So there's one

platform which I I'm very closely connected is the big O health. So they connect remote areas to hospitals which are not only cancer cancer cardiology uh where patients need help. So they

connect them and so that the diagnosis can be met quickly over a phone or over a video consult and then the patient can be directed to a treatment in his own place if the facilities are available or

he can be given a date a quicker date in a hospital in a government hospital or a private hospital anywhere in the cities. So I think cancer has been benefited most um among many other specialities

with the AI and it is a way forward. Yeah, that's wonderful. Democratizing of the health care treatment is happening in everywhere. So, how about in cardiology Dr. Tanoj the how the AI

helping democratizing the uh treatment? &gt;&gt; So, uh means that is absolutely important to give the best treatment to everyone. that we all know by experience that we doctors especially in

interventional cardiology there we learn by experience and I think so AI has gone way forward in interventional cardiology in enhancing our experience so there are

certain complex procedures like perccutaneous valve replacement like left atrial appendage closure so we don't do that routinely but now we have AI uh protocol calls in which like a

virtual reality we can 3D uh do the 3D imaging by a 3D CT scan and before we go actually on the patient we can simulate those with the help of AI and predict the problems and this kind of learning

it has actually revolutionized the care in structural heart disease intervention. So what we used to do with the open heart surgery around a decade back right now it is being done

perccutaneously like trans catheter aotic valve replacement trans catheter mital therapies left atrial appendage closure and we know when not to go ahead and uh one beautiful use of AI at our

own hospital so we had a very young girl with a left atrial appendage aneurysm so it's not I'm not taking you into the details but I'm telling you this is one of the 200 cases in the history of

mankind which we have 238 cases which and it was one of its peculiar kinds and with the use of virtual reality with re 3D reconstruction we were able to predict what complications we could face

even without entering the heart and such kind of preparation it is possible only with the advent of AI and as you just mentioned uh cardiology has might be changing its shape from reactive

medicine to predictive medicine but also in the therapy part it will really really help in identifying the right patient and doing the right procedure and it will give us experience it will

give us intelligence in a very very short span of time. &gt;&gt; So Dr. Dr. Tanuj you mentioned correctly like uh it is helping now you know AI to get integrated into the healthare system

it has to go through the clinical trial. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Would you like to highlight that how uh currently the clinical trial and this AI based tool is going through in

cardiology? So that is where I think so the challenge lies means conventionally I'm uh I'm a research director at my institute also we do have a lot of randomized control trials around 14

randomized control trials in cardiology working but all of them one thing which they require is data privacy and AI works on a cloud-based system so we do whenever we use AI we all are afraid of

losing our data And in context of research this is extremely important. And whereas AI is extremely extremely good. I would caution to its overuse in population that the trial data does not

represent. So a trial of AI which is done in US may not be applicable to a cohort in India or Pakistan or Bangladesh. That is not possible. So but again uh understanding so we don't have

to overfit. We don't have to underfit. We have to choose the right thing. And henceforth maybe even in cardiology it's extremely difficult to conduct a trial. Unfortunately with despite the rapid

advances even AI gets its pitfalls and it tends to autocorrect itself and AI works at a level where human mind cannot reach. So that is another so that is known as the blackbox problem. So we are

not able to connect those dots. AI is able to connect those dots. It may it may even force us to see something which is not true. So we have to be extremely cautious what protocol we are applying

and to which subset we are applying. We are not overfitting, we are not underfitting and henceforth RCTs. We've we've had RCTs. So there is something known as a state HF trial which helped

us predict heart failure before it actually happened and I think so this is this is Kore device or a microcore device it it is uh something beneficial but getting it to the masses and with

that kind of RCTs. So maybe AI would actually change this is something very futuristic but maybe over the period of time AI would dictate that we have to change our methodology of research too.

&gt;&gt; So that is wonderful. Uh we talk about privacy aspect of it. When we talk privacy then the ethical aspect come. So Dr. Surupa uh how the ethical aspect is taking uh pay taking care in the

oncology treatment where AI is getting used how what uh precaution we should uh keep. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So uh this is another very important asp as aspect along with the

legal and the other things the ethics is very important and uh when we so the first thing we use we do is that when the patient comes we are always discussing with the patients very

openly. A written consent is if we are using an AI tool, it has to be discussed with the patient which AI tool we are using and how much we are depending on it and a written consent has to be taken

with the patient. And the other thing is that how much dependent should we be on the AI tool that also comes in the area of ethics because uh the AI like we know they depends on the data which has been

fed. So there should not be an algorithm bias. So the data should be from diverse specialtities, diverse uh sources which has to be fed so that the results we get they are more true. So this is another

aspect. Uh another is that the equality. So there should be equality in the patients who are treated with the AI tools. So many times we do not know that which are the patients who are need to

be prioritized. So that needs to be treated and and also not not only that it will be very um very surprising to know that many times AI priority is given to people staying in the higher

the more influential areas or who are more influential. So these equalities should be uh minimized equality should be maximized and most importantly is that uh whenever we are using an AI data

then uh Everybody, everybody should be undergoing uh whenever we are using it. U like I said in the previous also the human should be there. We should not be fully dependent on the AI tools and it

has to be told to the patient also that there is a human in the loop and it is the human it is the doctor who is the oncologist who is making the decision and the AI is just helping it. It just

helps in the accuracy. It helps in the uh quickness of the of the treatment and the diagnosis but the control has to be with the patient with the physician. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So the control has to be the

patient and that is also the EU AI act and the data guidance is there that the human intervention human should be in a control. So now Dr. uh Kiran uh you know the AI can also be used unethically and

different kind of AI tools has to follow the ethical guideline. Uh what what is your say on that that how the ethics is getting and compliance is getting maintained there?

&gt;&gt; Yeah the ethics and you know morality and the compassion all these things as Dr. Dr. Sarupa said here in my reproductive field also it actually works well know it has to be taken care

of because uh ethically we should inform the couple that AI is going to actually select the embryo or select the usite or do the Ixie help to us but finally the doctor and the embryologist will be the

one who will say yes this embryo has to put because your role is also very very important you can't actually hand over all your role to the AI and then finally you have to take taken consent also from

the patient that AI will be actually doing this this this for you. But finally they would come and ask you only whether you are responsible or the company which actually made set up your

AI system is responsible or you know the doctor who did the embryo transfer is responsible or the people who have set up the AI you know all that paraphernalia is responsible. So that

kind of legal things also come in. So we have to be very very careful and uh very compassionate. &gt;&gt; So that is wonderful state. uh in the audience. Do you have any question for

our uh panelist? One question we can take. Yes. &gt;&gt; Can you give some insights about this? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So we have um especially means at every step from diagnosis to treatment

we do have protocols AI enabled ECG monitoring can help us reduce the time to delay to catlab it's very important if a person has chest pain diagnosing that patient early and with AI automated

tools with ECG detection of ST elevation will really help and it will also prevent unnecessary calls. So there has been a study which said that unnecessary activation of catlab reduced from 42% to

8%. By of AI tools. So that's ECG. Echo made it faster. You have intervention guided uh procedures like FFRCT. There is a protocol you can know the significance of a stenosis by AI enabled

protocols on CT on simple angiograms without intervening. And then in the therapeutic armamentarium you have vis uh virtual reality protocols you have OCD I mentioned a protocol of OCD that's

MLDD max protocol we can guide our stent size we can decide what to do with the lesion whether to treat it or not so uh it is reducing uh it will help us prevent the healthcare bird burnout also

so AI is not something we are using for uh luxury it might become a uh part and parcel of everyday practice in the times to come. &gt;&gt; So Dr. Tanoj uh he has one more question

please. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So uh we are working on variables. So we call this as variables. They come with uh little bit of caution. As I said, we

should try to see which kind of people will actually benefit the most. So these rings, they can help you predict heart rate. They can predict the incidence of AF in the times to come. It can predict

sudden cardiac deaths. So it might not be applicable to helpful for everyone but in a high-risisk population definitely. &gt;&gt; So the let let let me thank you. Uh we

have our time limit. So uh now we are uh we have a wonderful discussion now as a closing uh what is your final say Dr. Swalupa on where the societal impact will be there for AI in the healthcare

domain. &gt;&gt; So AI definitely is the way forward. So we have to adopt AI as quickly as possible and for that we have to train ourselves and our colleagues in all the

AI aspects so that we can use it faster and we can use it in uh in a broader aspect. &gt;&gt; So how about uh Dr. Kiran in the reproductive domain?

&gt;&gt; I totally concur with Dr. Sorupa what she said actually when the computers came in also they said no need to do all that we can always calculate but here we are today. So same way AI also is very

very important in our medical field. Uh but what place you give it and how you actually take the help of it. So we should go hand in hand with AI the doctors and uh because AI is not going

to replace the surgeon or the you know whatever doctor is there reproductive medicine doctor or any speciality doctor. So we have to work hand in hand and then with that accumulative and

synergistic thing we can achieve more. &gt;&gt; So the caution should be there that should go hand in hand. How about uh Dr. Tanoj? &gt;&gt; Uh uh means in my field cardiology I

will not let AI take the pilot seat till the time it is ready. It it can at the most be a co-pilot. It can guide me a bit but it we but it is very very distressing as I was mentioning the AI

protocols sometimes they dictate and we realize that it is wrong. So we have to be cautious about that. So AI based learning it is directive at times. So we it has if if it is a supervised learning

it's okay if it is a unsupervised learning which it is trying to extrapolate then we have to be extremely cautious. So but all said and done I think so since the health care system is

so overarched it's so strained I think so if we welcome this AI we may reduce the health care costs we are not increasing the health care cost we will reduce the health care cost but for all

doctors we have to view that our entire strategy would change we will not be in the conventional way of handling things we have to move ahead we have to grace with grace

&gt;&gt; so that is wonderful ful said we discuss on various topic like you know the hand in hand it should go and AI can democratize the health care to larger population and but we have to be

cautious that where to be used and where not to be used and definitely definitely I agree with you Dr. Sorupa that the doctor should not be replaced with the complete autopilot AI mode. So with this

I would like to yeah we have a very extreme panelist they are the top doctors in their field. You can have a discussion with them after the session. So with this we will end this panel

discussion. Now we have another speaker uh for keynote speech uh Dr. Gan Gupta and she will be taking over. So Dr. Arif can you please come? I hope that it helped us to understand

the AI and impact in the society. Ladies and gentlemen, as we move towards the closing of this inaugural session, it's my great opport pleasure to invite our keynote speaker to the stage. We are

honored to have Dr. Gonjan Gupta Goil, founder of Gundan IVF World, a distinguished expert in reproductive medicine who has contributed significantly to advancing fertility

science and patient awareness. Also, please join me in warmly welcoming Dr. Gundan Gupta Goil. Thank you Arif, Dr.

and Arctic University Norway for giving me a chance to come and speak on this platform where we are going to talk about navigating innovation, ethics and regulatory compliances and AI in its

role in fertility and healthcare. As I am I am a fertility specialist uh working in the field of IVF and fertility and FRC and FICO. A little about myself before I begin. It

is like that. Yes. Uh I have been working a lot with AI innovation in the field of fertility and healthcare and that was the reason I was recently awarded with the feminina achievers

award besides the other things. And uh a little journey about myself. Uh I uh came from UK in 2009 where I was practicing and after that I started uh working in the field of women health.

But yes uh women health led to the need for motherhood and fertility and that's how I started my chain Gunja world which has been doing very well uh and we have been giving results in that. uh the most

important part but of course is how we have uh created an Indian impact on and our research has been uh coming on the global impact as well because we have presented uh our research in Eshray

Europe in Copenhagen and Amsterdam and again the AI based innovation which I'm going to talk about we recently presented at St. Antonio ASRM. Uh so uh I have also authored the first book on

egg freezing which is the new domain which we need to talk about and we need to start working. So uh can I have less noise please? It's too noisy. Can you please close the door? Thank you.

Thanks. So basically the role of AI in IVF it is very very important. We know around one six of the people are suffering for fertility. In India also we have around 25 to 30 million people

who are facing this problem. So what we need to understand fertility is a bit challenging. Why? Because you know no two people with similar histories will have a similar outcome. Then again uh

cardiac midby you can predict as Dr. Tanj was saying but when it comes to fertility do do embryos behave the same way? No. So that is where maybe the AI could be an important thing and from

here I speak not as a technologist but as a clinician because I'm a person who has to answer those questions like why did my IVF fail? Will it work this time? What changes are you doing? So that is

where AI has a very very important I feel in IVF and fertility and again IVF is a datadriven thing. You know the we have a data rich around the hormones, the doses, the tests, the

investigations, the imaging, the lab parameters, the embryo development, the clinical history. So and historically we have been depending upon human interpretation and experience. This is

the time by including AI we will reduce the subjectivity and bring consistency in complex decision and this is where we have to work. Now we come to patiententric AI. What we can do at

Bunjin Nav, we have recently developed a AI based fertility meter which is based on BMI, the physical parameters like the BMI, the age and other things. But besides that we have also included

social parameters, the lifestyle changes and that will give us an outcome as to her chances of her natural fertility, her chances of IVF success and how to help in her IVF journey and it has been

developed for single males, females and couples. The advantage is that it reduces it gives the couples a clearer vision, a clear answer and also reduces emotional and financial burden. So this

is how our fertility meter looks like. It can uh this is the different tracks we are doing and this is the biological the environmental and the socioeconomic things I was talking about. So this was

about the fertility meter. The other thing which we have innovated is AIdriven personalization of the human menopausal goodadotropen doses. It's such a beautiful thing because it's a

smart way to dose uh develop the dose which we need to stimulate then it is datadriven and based on AI machine learning we have moved on from one size fits all it has a high accuracy which

we've seen around 90% so it is more cost efficient it is brings safety first we prevented over over stimulation and accessible yeah this is the uh thing which we have presented at ASR in San

Antonio last year just uh last year in 2025 and that is where it personalizes the profile and also includes if the lady has gone under previous stimulation and

gives us an outcome. So this is how it looks like on the UIUX interface and I will just show you a small video as to how it works. So here we are filling in all the data.

So we put the age, the AMH, the height, the weight and the count. And then it we just have to click. So a click of button it will give us the HMG dosing strategy that is what is the stimulation. So we

got a stimulation the dose for 9 days and the dose is required. So this is the beauty of it because that will reduce the burden on the doctor. It will reduce uh it will make it much more easier

because My nurse can calculate the dose. My in fact my EA can calculate the dose because all she needs to do is fit in things and we get an answer for that. Uh of course it doesn't rule out the role

of doctor but it makes things easier. So where we are this was two indigenous things which IVF has developed and now talking about where we are using AI most important is semen analysis you know it

is it is a test which has been done over the years but has been manually dependent. But what what is an AI based system? It is so beautifully that it assesses mortality. It assesses

morphology and then it generates a video back report. I will uh again play the video. You can see this is the blue sperms which is the actively motile sperms and it is reproducible. It can

also be checked again and again. So it is a meaningful upgrade. If we talk about these things then of course as Dr. Kiran has already talked about it it is the embryo selection yes we have AI

based embryo selecting uh tools which are available which help us you can say they are a guidance they are not an absolute end to things but yes they do help us to guide as to which embryo

would give a better outcome it is datadriven it is based on multiple multiple uh which it has gone and of course it is you can say used as an adjunct to an embryologist.

So this is the major thing which I tried to cover because 10 minutes is a very short time and now where India stands today. Of course we are at an inflection point today. It is a time where things

are going to change. We have no doubts about it. India how does it have an advantage? Why? Because we have large and diverse populations. We have lot of data. We have cost efficient IVF

delivery. highly skilled clinicians and embryologist and rapid digitalization of healthcare. Our challenges of course is the fragmented clinical data, limited large scale validation studies on Indian

patients because most of the data is westernbacked and uneven access beyond the metro cities. So we are in a time when India is adopting AI but we need to start shaping it and beyond this where

AI would Further I feel it will be helpful also in predicting what is the going to be the miscarriage rate what are the chance of a the baby we will be delivering in when it comes to AI and

fertility cycleto cycle optimization and of course most important democratizing IP that is the quality should be better we should be using AI as I showed you my calculator in smaller

clinics tier two tier three cities and young embryologists and of course combining AI with uh genetics would help us in predicting reducing the failed cycles lowering miscarriage rates and

focused on healthy outcomes. So this was uh about it and it is the time to understand but AI cannot replace clinical judgment, experience, empathy and trust between the doctor and the

patient. Fertility care of course is deeply human and we have to act responsibly and but there is an opportunity of course for India's to build fertility AI data sets and develop

AI solutions which are also affordable for global use. the uh these uh uh platforms which I have developed is with help of my daughter Samriddi who is just currently a student of Kellogg but

otherwise an engineer. So she put in the uh efforts to do all the coding which of course as doctor I cannot do. So this is just a final look at one of my centers. Uh how we

love to work and do things. Heat. Heat. So with that I bring my talk to end with just one note that success in creating AI would be biggest event maybe in human

uh history but it can also become the last event if we don't use it judiciously. Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you audience. Uh thank you
