## 📝 Transcript

support is a lot of pilots, but what women and communities need is sustained delivery and sustained engagement. And I think that's where the breakdown is happening for women that we especially

work with in resource constraint environments both in rural and urban settings that that sustained engagement is something that is currently not available.

&gt;&gt; Uh thanks thanks DA. Uh I think from my perspective I do see a lot of well-intentioned funding coming into AI for health initiatives really good teams such as Maya Mahila working on the

ground working with communities philanthropic actors who are really passionate about solving this challenge right but at the end of the day so what they have to reckon with is a system

that has been chronically underfunded over the past many many decades right we have primary health infrastructure in many many regions you know outside of our own bubbles of Delhi and Kerala and

Bangalore where primary health care centers continue to remain undisted underresourced plus there is also the issue of simply having good well-connected doctors

available right we simply do not have that currently in many villages over and above that there's the added layer of and I and I don't see that being articulated enough is that health

care is also dictated by a lot of patriarchal norms for women right that access to doctors to clinics it is itself mediated by male members in the household right uh there is a very uh

specific practice in terms of shared handsets right a lot of women are unable to even access healthcare chat bots that are very well their UI UX is fantastic right but women simply don't have access

or private access to a lot of those chat bots over and above that I also feel and this is I think specifically something that needs to be discussed with the kind of funding that's coming within the AI

for healthcare space is that whose problem are you really solving for and who's helping you diagnose the problem right is it a topdown diagnosis right is it done by philanthropic actors tech

companies sitting in Silicon Valley who have no visibility of the kind of challenges we see women in many many different under disadvantaged parts of India facing or is it something that is

happening bottom up right so as part of even my work with Mina Mahila Foundation when we went within the slum areas in Bombay right there was almost a process of co-development

understanding how are women interacting with technologies how do they access healthcare what kind of questions do they have Right? And it's not always classic like, oh, should I take

paracetamol? It's not even the right language. It's not the right terminologies and those things can only be surfaced through sustained community interactions.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. I think uh Tanya and Arushi have covered it very well. Uh, additionally, there are two three points I can briefly make. One is that the health care system has systemic

inequities &gt;&gt; and technology is just uh one of the channels to deliver or solve for it. So it's not like a silver bullet.

&gt;&gt; Uh but just like any technology hype like internet, IoT, uh cloud, big data, AI has the potential and an opportunity for us to reset some of these inequities. And that won't happen

through funding. That will happen through intention. And uh that intention needs to be not just from the people who are funding which I think a lot of people have that intention but through

and through in the system private and public both. Uh the second point is around historical marginalization. The data that AI is taking is uh biased because the data in the world today is

biased. Anything that is built according to market forces, any product or service will be biased because it is patriarchal in nature. Uh and it is typically mostly highly conservative and traditional in

nature. That's the data. How do we again use this as an opportunity to put checks and balances proactively build something which is yes for the binary gender but also for the non-binary gender. So it is

actually a big opportunity but as is if we let it continue it will be the same biases now magnified with all the hallucinations in that way. So it's a a tricky thing we need to figure.

&gt;&gt; So you all kind of alluded to the existence of systemic um challenges in the sector gender kind of differentials that shape who accesses healthcare. So these are these are issues that are not

new uh both to healthcare and to digital health and of course not new to AI. So I'm very curious now you know given that we have this long history of failed pilots in the space of digital health

and m health uh this concern around pilotitis as we call it in the development sector. What can we learn from this history of past efforts to actually inform future AI

efforts? And here you know when when I say AI I'm taking a broad framing. So not just large language models there may be more predictive models there might be a range of AI tools but how do we

prevent these solutions from meeting the same fate? What can we learn? And then on the funding side what are funders looking for in terms of evidence given that we have this history of failures in

the space. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hi. So I mean if I can share from my construct. So we work with lot of CSRs and so philanthropies also two kind of one is CSRs and other is a I would

say philanthropies like outside India and uh in CSR they are very cyclical in nature. So lot of uh funding which goes into healthcare we have seen it's very one year duration and healthare systems

look for long-term funding. So this is I see one constraint and uh when funer like I think in the CSR construct when they look for healthcare funding they are they are not building solution. I

mean we as a technology company build solution but their problem statement is how do I get more data? How do I get more dashboards these health solutions are not designed to solve for the how do

you reduce burden for the healthare worker on the ground? How do these AI solutions integrate in the workflows of the program? Um and also once the funding let's say one year twoear

funding goes away then what is the long-term viability of it uh CSR funding also not looked at unit economics of the scalability aspect of it. There's also no integration with the other government

healthcare systems. So these are some of the while we say there's a 30,000 cr CSR fund but and part of it also goes in the healthcare but beyond one-ear programs or 2-year program I keep seeing these

getting diluted and not get institutionalized within the government uh ecosystem. So those are some of the areas I think we need to look for and so that they can sustain beyond the the

pilots. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe I'll be the optimist in on the panel, right? And u and I'll say that you know one of the ways that we've always looked at this

question of inequities etc. is is there early signs that this is getting better. Right? I think we need to remember that AI is still an infant or maybe a young child now

that's just growing into our ecosystem, right? Um are we seeing offshoots that access um you know decision making overall benefit as far as outcomes is

concerned is specifically for marginalized underprivileged groups is getting better. I I think the answer is yes. Uh I mean if you go to Kenya and and we look at how um sex workers are

using AI to self diagnose whether they have HIV RDTS read positive or negative and whether they are able to then um subsequently order prep for themselves that is access that they never had

before. Um right if you go to Odisha and you look at how um technology like cervical smart scopes is being used to early screen women for cervical cancer. Yes it is getting better. right? Uh are

we there yet? And and I think the the classical answer to the question is no. There's a long way to go, right? I mean, so so for sure. Um but what does it take to really get there, right? How do you

really now start to incorporate all of this into mainstream as far as healthcare is concerned or um we've coined a word for it, we call it systematize AI inside the public health

system or or inside the health system itself, right? I think there is a couple of components that we need to be very very careful of right um and I think part of those steps are now being

started to be taken by governments themselves right very few sectoral AIEL policies themselves right so it starts at the governance level itself right do you have a trusted mechanism that's

going to certify validate some of the tech that's coming in is it starting to happen now yes again you know we we're launching the policy now as far as India is concerned There's there's a couple of

other countries that have launched these policies as well. Um and perhaps that'll get more and more common, right? Do we have a system for and and this is where the departures are, right? We've been

used to the pharma world. We've used to the medical devices, diagnostics, technology world, right? There one certification is all you need. &gt;&gt; Once certified, you're done. That's not

true for AI, right? You have to do this again and again and again and again. So now you're suddenly entering into a world of life cycle validation and trust building on the AI itself. Are we set up

for that just as yet? No, I think there's ways to go on there. Right? So those for me are stage gates, right? I mean are you safe? Are you protected? Is there enough privacy security in the

system itself? Is there reliability in the system itself? That is stage gates. Right? But perhaps more importantly, it is understanding whether our processes, whether our

people and whether our priorities have been set right or are or not. Right? So how how are you set up in order to be able to do it? So a lot more effort needs to go into the that side of the

equation, right? Um for fear of taking a little bit of time, I'll tell you a little bit of a story, right? So our very first AI training that we did for auxiliary nurse midnights which are

really frontline care providers in India um you know we went to them and we started talking to them about here's a predictive model that we're introducing. You know what their first question was

their first question was not about whether this is AI or what kind of tech is being used. Their first question was if this system is going to do that what is my identity afterwards? right? What

is my role going to be? And and I think we need to spend a lot more time preparing our workforce for that and I think the last part of it you've really touched on, right? Where does the

sustainable finance really come from? Um, right? This is not a one-time job, right? You have to spend time even for an LLM in that manner and and you know I pra and others and we were talking

yesterday on how having individuals who can constantly monitor, govern, retrain, train, evaluate the output all of that is is necessary, right? Forget about ground truthing. That is another whole

layer that needs to constantly be established. So I think the the fundamental plumbing that is needed in order for AI's water pump to continually push out water is still being built as

we speak. Right? So it's nice to experiment with newer water pumps and uh and newer downstream things, but I think some of the upstreams work uh is still a work in progress. Uh right, but we'll

get there. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Uh thanks AJ. And I I think um I'll I'll also be the optimist and I also wanted to say that as a community we probably need to uh give ourselves a

bit of grace uh in terms of this space particularly because as uh AJ described you know there are several sort of elements which we need to figure out but I think certainly the intention is there

and as you as you said there's a lot of attention to the space and we are all sitting here. So I think um you know uh let's take it with a slight positive frame. Um now from my perspective I'm a

sort of more an implement programmer so I'll bring in uh and and then also work with a you know funding institution so uh I'll try and bring in some experience from previous initiatives and you framed

it that way you know the digital solutions pilotitis etc you know we've all had experiences and I'll speak largely about initiatives which actually uh systemled and potentially also led to

the scale and I think I'll mention couple of elements which I felt and through experience seen um you know have led to um you know increased scale or you know uh improved scale of some of

those solutions and I think first one I you know beyond uh governance and all the elements Anuna mentioned um I think the change management aspect you know which he touched upon it's a really

really critical you know pointer which we often neglect when we you know uh enter into a solution space uh with a quest to actually testing it out in a controlled environment ment you know

when you go to scale there is a huge amount of sort of people uh engagement to the process which need to be figured out and you know as I said you know we need to give ourselves grace but also

build time and energy uh and engagement uh for for users for administrators and uh for managers for that process. So I think that is another element which you need to bring uh as as we move forward

uh with a solution to scale. Second also when we talk about systems I think also looking at a system scale owner I mean often times you know there are many owners of the success of a program there

might not be as many owners of a failure or learning from failure um so from that perspective having a good sort of identified institution it could be individual I'd prefer institutions

actually owning the scale attention to the program so I think that's another element which we if we give attention to uh right from the beginning you know uh we've seen uh solutions getting to scale

but now quickly talking about what people look for when you're you know investing in newer solutions I think you know one has been mentioned enough in this panel right client centricity is

absolutely essential so you know people who are using it they should feel comfortable and actually more empowered so I I I will not dwell on that but often times the most common sensical

thing is you know a problem and solution orientation right often times there is a solution which is a valid And then you know we are there are times when we are finding problems for that that solution.

So I think you know what problem the solution set is actually uh talking about uh and you know responding to I think that attention uh right from the beginning uh you know you know improves

uh the investment potential for that solution and as u um um Sunandan mentioned the system integration elements right so because any such solution is going to interact with the

existing infrastructure or existing system in terms of you know the digital infrastructure or human care potential etc. So that needs to be also considered and you know that element needs to be

figured out. Uh I'll pause here for now and see you know if there are other reflections. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you for that and uh lots of parallel kind of common threads here

kind of really thinking about system integration really thinking about also like having grace for ourselves as we make mistakes and and kind of thinking about how do we sustain these within

institutions more broadly. Um since uh uh Dr. you mentioned like the stage gating and kind of the the safety piece and I want to dig into that a little bit more cuz I'm sure that's uh that's uh at

the forefront for a lot of people. So part of the challenge with the generative systems in particular is that they are unpredictable and it's hard to kind of evaluate once and then have a

certification or or things like that. So there have been some seriousa safety concerns that have been raised. There have been documented cases for instance in the US now around like suicide and

self harm. So how do we think about safety? How do we make these systems work for us in the kinds of contexts we are in? Especially given that these are some of the most vulnerable people,

right? So uh we'll we'll maybe start with Pak and then yeah. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hello. Yeah. Uh thanks. This is a very interesting and quite highly debated topic right now right there is the uh

really positive aspect everyone's excited like you said we all are here and then there is the really dark underbelly which is not as much talked about uh around the harms and stuff so

uh I go back to the thing that AI is again a tech it's not good or bad and just like any technology we need a stronger legal framework around it that gives protection ction, a rightsbased

approach. At the same time, we also need an industry body or a coalition that agrees to self-regulate themselves so that the governance angle and and the load is reduced. And third, we need

civic society which is also taking up and saying this is not good. Right? There's always this discussion that privacy of data, how much is it important for who? And yesterday uh

someone in one of the events was saying if someone's getting this for 10 rupees versus 100 and their data is privacy is not so good what would they say now I'm I'm just saying there are very uh

interesting uh arguments being made in this way but we do need to make sure for folks who are again historically marginalized we need proper protections and that is a

large part of our country actually right and people who don't have a lot of economic say which is also large part of our country. We are a poor country today in those terms despite all the growth

that is coming. Uh taking one or two specific examples you talked about uh people unaliving themselves and like really doing self harm and stuff. Uh there is also a lot happening around

with children. It's unregulated. It's almost like a race to the bottom for the LLMs, right? Uh that how many users can I get? So again I if we had to look at this as an opportunity there is an

opportunity it's the early days we can have good examples lead by those examples we have like uh large scale implementers here like large scale funders we have like think tanks here uh

in the panel. So if you can lead by examples and establish that here are four five ways you can do this adopt it in the system uh which is acceptable by people then there is something to

replicate. So yeah that's a high level take from me. &gt;&gt; Uh thanks thanks Raok. I think um we've at digital futures lab have been thinking about AI safety a lot

especially how safety looks like when we apply it to context outside of the US and UK right a lot of the AI safety discourse is currently dominated by western institutions and there's of

course a need to take a contextual lens even more so when we talk about AI and healthcare in India right that the contextualized lens needs to be further sort of zoomed in now and it's it's sort

of worth breaking down this problem, right? So, let's imagine a scenario of all the things that can go wrong when somebody from an underprivileged disadvantaged background whose

environment has been chronically undisturbed. There are no doctors around is suddenly introduced to an AI based chatbot which is also designed to appear as a human the the behab

right and the narrative around the chatbot is that you can ask any healthcare related questions to this chatbot especially when you can't access a doctor. So in this scenario let's try

to unpack what all can go wrong right and for this we've tried to use a very simple framework we the first almost foundational set of harms is around the very nature and reliability of the

information that the chatbot provides right a lot of the chatbots as I mean as is very well established a lot of them are of course catering to high resource languages English even Hindi in the

Indian context is a high resource language, right? But a lot of individuals in India want to interact with a chatbot in their own dialects, right? In their own regional language

and for that the quality of AI models is not as high as we see for English chatbots. So a lot of those regionally customized chat bots are prone to hallucinations. They can provide

incomplete information while all at the same time sounding extremely authoritative and confident. Right? So there's a very real harm of an individual taking the advice provided by

a not so welld designed not so well fine-tuned AI chatbot and relying on their advice for medical purposes for even for personal emotional purposes right so that's the first kind of harm

the second kind of harm could also be very much in the form of psychological harms right when I disclose something personal something that is also prone to social taboos when it comes to medical

issues. The chatbot might also respond in a manner that could be judgmental, that could be rude, that could be harsh. And this is possible because the chatbot's also picking up on the

conversations that are happening in our social and physical sphere, right? The third kind of harm, I would imagine, is more structural in nature, which is that harm is not always episodic. It's not

always going to happen in one chatbot interaction I'm having. It can also unfold over years and years and months, right? It can outlive the length of the pilots, right? So, for example, if a

person is only relying on a medical chatbot for advice while not having access to solid physical infrastructure, they can come to over rely on the chatbot, right? It can over time shape

their health-seeking behavior. it can increase emotional dependence on the said chatbot. So I would imagine that when we talk about safety, we sort of unpack it and we really look at it a

from a contextual lens and b in this multi-dimensional manner. Sorry, I just I know I only spoke about problems but I am optimistic about this space too.

&gt;&gt; Can I perhaps just add one point to it? Right. I I think um I think it's very important to understand where this harm comes from more right is it coming through structured bots that have been

trained that have rag ecosystems behind them that have strong governance behind them etc. I think that is perhaps a lesser part of the evil right. I think the bigger piece is coming from random

conversations that then you start having with the chat GPTs and the Geminis and the Claudes etc of the world right um and but therein lies perhaps a little bit of our fault as an ecosystem as well

right um so let me use the analogy um for cars right um how many of you have looked at crash ratings for cars right you know that crash ratings exist on cars right it's a very very

wellpublished database that tells you exactly how a car fares. It's a quantified number. Uh it all the details about safety there. Performance of a car is there. Do we have the same thing for

some of these bots? &gt;&gt; No. Right. And I think we've just not had the system of bringing not just evaluation but visibility to the evaluation on a lot of this tech itself.

Right. Um I I think if we brought more publicity to it, right? I mean imagine a cigarette packet essentially saying this is harmful, right? Uh but you do it in a much more amplified manner now and and

and constantly say that chat GPT or Gemini or Claude or whatever, you know, has these warnings to it, right? Do we have a warnings label that all of these can then carry? I think that's the piece

that I would want us to potentially get to in the future that we have these crash ratings available for these these bots themselves. Um I think both of you have raised a

bunch of important points and I'm very I'm very excited to also talk about it because these are the things that we grapple with and because being a ground level implementer I am coll-located with

the communities that we serve and I think the perspective there is very very interesting one talking to the harm piece here is that we are working with women so there's always that equity

issue there's an access issue there's also the taboo and we work in social sexual and reproductive health so Again a very very sensitive topic. I think what we decided when we were talking

about client centricity is that we also have a chatbot called menabolo and the idea there was that in these in these settings if we introduce an AI chatbot which is giving misinformation and

that's basically ruining everything that we've been doing for the past decade right so we have a ragbased model and the what we've learned and we've deployed it in multiple use cases rural

case in Andhra Pradesh and Kopam we're using it in urban slums in Mumbai Okay. And what we've realized the uniform theme that's emerged is that one accuracy medically verifiable accuracy

is extremely important especially because these are resource constrainted environments. They don't have access to information and the access on information on internet you know is

anybody's guess on the quality there. So one is that the second is how they are able to access the information is it available at a time and in a manner that's convenient to the client. So, a

lot of our clients are actually using the bot 11 to 3:00 a.m., right? Because that's when the household chores are done. That's when they can actually sit and think about themselves. So, having

something available to them. The third is the important point of language, right? And it's not just language saying the our chatbot is available let's say in Hindi English in Telugu but also

English ming English ting English for you know for taking the language um forward but also contextualization of the language you know I was making this point to someone earlier that it's very

easy for us to say periods or it's very easy for somebody to translate it to Mahavari in Hindi but that's not how the community talks about their periods. Right? A lot of us will use colloquial

terms like chums. They will say mahina and there are several other terms for it in marathi and telu. If that sort of localization is not built in the language

then you know the response whether it's a rag based model or it's chat GPT or whatever the response is not what the user has asked you for. And that's the sort of localization that we've built

into our chatbot. Making sure that we sat with the women and made them generate the queries and the language. So if you want to talk about periods, what's the language that you will use?

What is the language that you're comfortable in getting a response in? And then the chatbot obviously with being a technological solution, response to audio, video and all of those things

can come in. But so that sort of contextualization is extremely important is what we feel and we we're generating evidence to see how it basically shifts uh you know helpseeking behavior. It

shifts agency and you know the Gates Foundation is helping us with that. The second thing that you talked about an was evaluation and that's very very important. We have a western lens on how

these models have been made. The evaluation also has a western lens. So we have something called as the health bench right where all these big guys are evaluating themselves. And what Arza and

her team has been helping us and what research we put out that we're showcasing tomorrow is that even that metrics of evaluation does not factor into lo factor local context. So we put

our bot on that help and show evaluation and we were rated extremely poorly. And when we look at the answers, the answers that we gave are correct. It's just that the western model says that you know

eating bomb is not a source of protein because they just don't know what it is. They don't know what bombil is. I think a lot of people here don't know what bombil is. It's a typical fish that's

found in coastal Maharashtra and it's an absolute delicacy and everybody eats it and there's a whole business model. There are restaurants that only sell bombill. So

those guys don't know about bombill right. So if we say that we are telling our users eat bomb for protein which is locally available, culturally acceptable, they're saying no it doesn't

count as protein. So we're actually working on with the help of Ursa and her team try to bring evaluation models that work in our context that work in Asian context that work in Indian context and

that's very important I think one is not only looking at harm and evaluation but also recognizing that the eastern the social southeast Asian context the Indian context needs to come in because

everybody recognizes that the bulk of users are going to be here. We are going to have very interesting use cases some of which is our work that I'd encourage everyone to look at but those models and

that sort of language needs visibility when you know on a larger global scale as well &gt;&gt; thank you all for that rich uh discussion um I do want to give uh Dr.

Vicas and Sundan a chance to speak as well. So please feel free to add any comments on the localization and safety component. I'll add one more question which is uh really you know trying to do

this kind of work also takes um additional funding right often to build in safety guardrails to build an evaluation that's not something that might be included in a typical kind of

pilot funding mode. So how do you sustain those kinds of components especially as you try to scale your projects and really kind of keep the the human at the center of what we do while

continuing to expand our work. So would love to hear from you both. Yeah, maybe I would say uh in I can give one example I think from our experience what is the importance of localization.

I mean just because the term is also the name Dhwhani why we started Dhani we built the first software as an IVR software that's how the name Dhani also came in and uh 10 years ago there was a

nonprofit we working with they had they wanted to set up a call center wherein people can ask information and they were having five call center like uh for women helpline call or chandiga number

from agriculture ask another number and what was happening was that because uh one the local dialect. So this they work in Maywad region and while we understand Hiana but someone calling from Maywad

was not able to understand uh or the someone from Chandigar was not able to understand people language from Mayad. So within I think every 50 100 kilometers the dialect is also changing.

Mhm. And we built that IVR system wherein you could ask and second was the information which if you ask call a chandigar helpline and ask government scheme

block office that person sitting there will not have that local context. So we built an IVR system. So I'm saying when we reach or when we aim for localization I think

these local dialect and having u local information is very important whenever we solve for the localization part and the ability to make it on demand uh cost uh access to in cost of access to

information. These are some of the things uh which has to be solved for and by the way this software is running for 10 years. I believe when we reach the AI uh construct so hopefully this will move

from there's a human currently answering this IVR system eventually I believe with when the localization truly hits that it will be yeah solved. Thanks. And um I think um what what

Tanya mentioned I think really really important. Our engagement has also been particularly for me I mean learning experience in the sense that you know while all the elements of sort of uh

localization and you know um uh uh evaluation the context I think absolutely essential but I think what I really also appreciate uh as a part of the approach is actually this learning

mindset and you know often times there's when you're talking about pilots when you know um you know there there is um this uh speed at stake or you know this competition at stake often times the the

investments into sort of a structured learning process uh around the intended outcomes and also potentially harm you know I think often our miss and I really appreciate in our engagement at least

you know this attention to uh a sustained learning process I think has remained central and I think um you know from even from a sustainability perspective uh it's really important

right so you need to bring out the necessary evidence that's actually making the desired changes uh which is supposed to and second I think I I mean I mentioned it initially but I really

also feel that you know um apart from the model itself I think that people layer and investment that people layer is also really really uh important uh for sustainability and you know often

times you know while these are sort of client-f facing solutions but they're not sort of sitting in the vacuum right these clients so they are also interacting ing with this you know whole

system set and you know you'll engage you'll get some information and then you'll validate that information at least this is the reality of our context for today right so so so the surround

sort of layer of folks who are engaged in the same ecosystem u you know what's their experience and what's their understanding of the system uh of the solution set is also really important uh

so so that's another thing and finally from a sustainability perspective and this is again I'm repeating you know the integration within the operational sort of ecosystem

I think or whatever context you're working with you know if you're talking about public sector then you know how the solution set integrates that with that sort of keeping that right sort of

uh you know in your um like first set of things to be looked at um I think that's going to be really really important over &gt;&gt; thank you all for the really really interesting conversation I know we're

technically over time for the panel but really appreciate you all engaging and sharing your perspectives. Um we do want to give a chance for everyone in the room to engage. So we'll be moving on to

the speed networking session of uh today. So please uh continue to ask these questions and hopefully you'll get a chance to engage directly with the panelists as well. But thank you all so

much. &gt;&gt; Thank you Azra this and the panelist. It's been a very insightful conversation and a lot of parts of it I resonate with as we work on menabulu as well. So uh

we'll move on to speed networking like it says it'll be really quick. The idea is for us to connect across disciplines. So you will notice that you will have stickers on your tags. You'll be given

colorcoded stickers and if you do not find them you can connect with me or our colleague Draj who will kind of support you there and each color represents a discipline that

you're from and we uh we'll make it quick. We'll give you two minutes to find one person from another discipline another color so that you can connect with them and in the next slide I will

share with you the prompts that you could probably just use as a conversation starter which is the roadblocks that you're facing that you would like another discipline to kind of

answer for you. And while we are on short of time, so we'll do one round of it, but I would request and encourage you to kind of do it even outside this conversation that we have. So we'll

begin the speed networking. Let me know if you're all ready. I think we can get our feeds up and we can move around and meet the people that we are sitting next to as well.

Yeah. So yeah, these are the color codes and this is how you've been given the um tags. So yes, let's get started. We have 3 minutes from now to get this moving. Our panelists, please also join us in

this. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. It was lovely catching. Oh yeah, we have a small gift. We'll just give it to you. session as part of the AI impact summit

on one of the very important themes AI for her. How catalyst women leaders are driving responsible and inclusive AI. as part of ficky and flow ficky flow we are happy to present this session for the

part of the impact summit and it's an important area something which is very close to I think the people who are attending the session to everyone's heart that's what we go by the uh

philosophy we go by the term so we do understand why this subject comes into high importance before I continue can I request people at the back to take the seats Please

requesting everyone to kindly please settle down in the room. So as we are saying the subject of AI by her I'm sure many of you if I would ask how many of you relate to that

philosophy that how women leaders are very important for creating a really inclusive and a trustworthy AI when we talk about AI or for that matter any of the courses where this being talked

about we feel that women is just talked about as part of parity but I would like the attention to be drawn is to the important subject that from the grassroot level to the senos level how

the things are being taken care of how many people are actually able to complete the education how many into the STEM what is the uh I would say the how many people how many women are able to

go to the leadership roles and if I talk about the AI workforce what's the number we talking about the uh the universities the globally renowned universities give a number of 1/4 or a quarter of the

total AI workforce is currently a woman. And when we talk about AI, we know how it is trained. It is trained on the historical data. We know how the things would become different if we don't

pledge it now. So that's why it's very important to uh for a women to play a role in this. And why more so it's just not about getting the equality. It's about getting the perspective. It's

getting the safe and trusted AI, the accountability and the removing the biases. It's getting more transparency. So this is what the session is going to focus on. We have a really extreme good

set of panelists who have joined us today. I'm very thankful. It's a while it's all a woman led panel. I don't mean to say that we don't welcome men. We of course we request you to join us also in

the panel. The reason is we want our voices to be heard in a rightful manner. So we have with us today Miss Roma Data Chave managing director Google India in a session partner for this session. Uh

she will be also moderating the panel discussion. We have Miss Punam Sharma National President Fiki Flow. We would be having we also joined by Mr. Miss Ivana Bartoi Chief Pacy Office officer

Vipro Limited. Miss Sara vice president international government affairs Intel. Miss Sandy Varesi vice president India hub CTO energy and chair India R&amp;D council shared electric and misspel

chief growth officer spar CCTV. This is the panel. Can I have a round of applause for the panel and then I can I request Thank you. And can I now request uh Roma

to kindly deliver her welcome remarks and set the uh stage further for the interaction. &gt;&gt; Uh good morning everyone. Uh thank you for choosing to be here this morning for

this crucial uh conversation. Uh in my day job it's not very usual that I'm on a all women's panel. So really a pleasure to share the stage with all of you and the people in the audience. Uh

let me start by a small uh personal experience. Uh you know few years back one of my friends had bought this car which had a AI uh voice assistant in in the car. We were all very excited to

explore it. So uh a group of us got into the car. We tried to talk to the AI uh assistant in the car and while I was trying to give some instructions somehow the assistant was not getting what I was

saying. So I tried several times. I tried to speak slowly. I tried to make my voice clearer and somehow it was not picking it up. And in that moment, uh, one of my male friends just like leaned

in forward, said exactly the same words. And there you go. Uh, the assistant picked it up. Now, he laughed and said, "I think the car prefers my voice." We know it better, right? An assistant

doesn't have preference of voice. It depends on the data that it is trained on. So if the data is limited is narrow then the ability of that uh AI assistant to operate will also be very narrow and

limited. Of course we have come a long way and in in recent times I haven't come across u you know such examples. I'm a power user of Gemini being a Googler. Uh and today I can talk to

Gemini in English, in Hindi, in my native language which is Bengali. It not only understands what I say, it also picks up my tone on the days that I'm stressed and things like that. So we

coming a long way. Why I'm sharing these examples with you is that if we have to build technology for all and if you want to ensure that nobody's left behind uh we as part of this large ecosystem

whether we are policy makers part of the industry or organizations like ficky technology uh etc etc all of us will have to be very deliberate very conscious in how we are shaping this

techn technology because we do agree it's it's a huge opportunity for us but at the same time it's a responsibility to shape it really well. So today with this really diverse and impressive panel

uh we'll try to take this conversations a few level deeper uh and really unpeel the onion here understand what's happening today in the space and what's required to be done now this brings me

to a very optimistic theme or a vision that our honorable prime minister Shri Narendra Modi G has set for the AI imp uh a India AI impact summit and he said which basically means welfare for all

happiness for all. Now that's a massive vision and I'm hoping this conversation today will be a small responsible step towards making this huge vision a reality for all of us. So with that uh

should we dive in Saraka? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um so thank you Roma. I think uh for well with setting the tone and that was something I just started off with

that the historical data actually and we know that face recognition systems normally are over by if you talk about whether the darken tones or you talk about the women so but I'm happy to

learn that now the the advancements are happening and we the systems are able to recognize the tone as well so that's a really good news and we look forward to have many more for the all I would say

especially for India it's case study we have a 22 languages constitutionally recognized so it's very very important so yeah thank you Roma for setting the tone before we move move ahead with a

panel discussion can I request Miss Punam Sharmma G national president for the ficky flow to share her remarks and what is her feeling about it to over to you Punam G

&gt;&gt; yeah your convenience Please. &gt;&gt; Good afternoon everybody. So I really thank you all for giving me this opportunity sorry good morning uh to stand here and speak uh something about

tech. And before I start I want to tell you that my perspective will be from a very non- tech person who is very interested in tech but understanding also as I go along this talk I will be

understanding from very learned people in this panel and it'll be my pleasure to hear them. So I come from that background non- tech background and uh I know how powerful this technology of

ours is and how um things are changing and every few years a new technology arrives which disrupts which promises change and everything and it does and we saw computers coming in and we thought

what what is internet um we didn't think much about it and then it has now changed everything when smartphones came they were bulky they were big uh big phones like sorry phones and then when

we were we thought they were only for listening and talking to each other and then the smartphone cames and everything changed now we are doing everything on our phones today so changes come and AI

is the other change which is um you know come there and it's like open AI chat GPT has generated humanlike text answers complex questions and it assists in our everyday work. So like you said Roma um

surprisingly so I have started getting technologically savvy to to uh recently I was researching something and what does uh what do I get in chart GBT yes Punam G so it's become a

nationalist call I mean look at that some people might have called me Punam G somewhere or you know written and it's picked that up so it is there to stay with us and change things in our life.

Of course, there are many many I don't want to give you the data. I'm sure other people will be giving you how many 70% of the world's population is using it. Of course, there is uh diet because

um some of the developed countries use it more and the underdeveloped uh countries use it less. But we are also going at a very fast speed and uh Indian users um you know whether computer you

know how we are good at computers. So we are reaching there and imbalance actually captures that data which is of uh bigger countries and about smaller countries women and men. So I feel it is

working so seamlessly that we barely notice it until it begins to reshape how we think how we work how we govern and how we lead. And though AI rises to a extraordinary 84%, India's AI journey is

clearly moving from pilots to performance and it is shaping our economic landscape and women though are under representated though I would say even in Frankfurt which is a hub uh a

major hub for tech only the 19% of the women are uh have AI talent uh there in women. So I'm specifically uh talking more on women because uh at fickflow we are there to power to empower women in

um business in work in skilling and that is why concerns of women is more for me. So um now of course they are under representative

and it has serious implications but other good news is that India leads globally in women's participation in STEM education with women accounting for 43% of annual STEM enrollments. 84,000

women are working in AI and ML roles and that is a number projected to be three lakhs in 2027. 7,000 women led AI startups across the country. That tells us we are moving

forward. Women are going ahead and does it translate into um influence that has to be seen. We are under representated and um yeah I heard about that's a common thing everybody's uh or like

Biden's voice was deep faked I think in the elections a year back in America and sent to everybody. So these are some challenges which we need to also talk about especially where women are also

concerned and responsible AI ethical AI um everything is very important but I do want to tell you something about fickflow so this year we have a lot of

initiatives whether it's industry whether it's skilling um digital uh skilling and literacy financial skilling and literacy but this year I thought that we should keep an initiative ative

which initiative means what we do in the center will then go down to our 21 chapters uh all over India and flow four by flow so about 25 areas it goes down to with 16,000 women working on it

working to power to empower and we did uh keep uh women in tech and STEM as one of the initiatives because we understood I I also understood the importance on how um this is the thing and why women

should come into leadership roles and we connected it to leadership women in leadership also. So on that this year the work a little bit of our work that we have done I would like to tell you

all and this will be an ongoing initiative now forever because this is so important. So we've had skilling um conclaves on AI. We've had AI conclaves. We had one in Delhi. We had one in um

Bangalore and uh we have placed it at the center of our national programming. Our responsibilities to ensure that women are not just spectators uh to this transformation but architects to it.

Very recently we had in Bangalore it was so interesting because there was a humanoid there for me. It was the first time I was seeing humanoid made by an Indian company and where all it can help

us uh was a big uh eye openener and there were many tech people and we bought about 350 entrepreneurs, professionals, decision makers for immersive engagement with AI

participants explored India first AI systems including building indigenous models, attending hand-on workshops, creating a second brain AI for research for writing for strategic decision

making and we moved from theory to adoption and we had even investors who who did pitch and tell us why investing in tech and why uh working with tech industries was so important for the

future. So we also have digital scaling in which we've conducted workshops such as AI powered design sprint with Canva build your Instagram content calendar in 30 minutes AI cyber safe AI smart I'm

trying to make it short uh scam survival guide festive magic with AI and everything connected and we are connecting in with all over India in these some of them are online a lot of

them are offline and uh I'm just trying to tell you all how important It is and we understand the importance of AI in today's life. In Pune, we are teaching children um uh how to make robotics. It

is our initiative and we all pull in and try and do that. 500 women in BLI, we are uh u women and children in robotics. We are training drone uh did with uh drone for agriculture from BSF to to

industry and everything. So the work has started and the work is in progress. We are preparing young girls with um all this and we are skilling reskilling and I was reminded recently of a

powerful thought that India today is powered by two AIs artificial intelligence and aspirational India which probably I will be talking about later. And um without uh taking too much

of your time I would like to sit also and listen to all the powerful women here here today. Thank you. Thank you Punamchi for putting the perspective from the grassroot level and the work

which is being absolutely fabulous work which is being done by ficky flow. I am really proud about the ladies who have joined us on the panel today. While I'll hand it over to you Roma for the

conversational discussion. I would request each one of you to please get because I did the introduction which is in the program but it's the work which you guys are really doing it in your

field and that is something what she's talking about aspirational AI so that's something is very important so I would want each of you to also reintroduce when Roma takes a conversation ahead

with you and over to you Roma next 30 minutes I'll take in the last two minutes only because Let me do a quick quick introduction of our really impressive panel today. I'll

start with Ivana who's on my right, chief privacy officer at Whipro Limited. Uh she's also the co-founder of women leading in AI network. Ivana is a globally recognized thought leader in

privacy, data protection and responsible technology and has authored the book an artificial revolution on power politics and AI. Let me start with you. uh you know Miss Punam Sharma spoke about how

the numbers in STEM is encouraging but as we keep moving upwards uh you know looking at solution architects people who are really designing uh uh the AI models and systems and policy makers and

so on and so forth from your experience and work can we do to ensure that we have adequate representation of women across areas that's really you know today shaping the digital future future

that we'll all uh that we all look forward to. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. And can you hear me? Yeah. And I'm absolutely delighted to be here. Um I love all women panels. I feel

there's always a lot of energy and a lot of uh thinking and uh and aspiration which is really good. You said something excellent. Um they said something b to to the to the sort of to the center of

you said something like fairness and equity needs to be engineered in AI and you know that because you come from Google. &gt;&gt; Um and this is the point I wanted to to

make with this regards. If we rely on the data that is out there, if we rely on the few people sitting in the room that are designing what are the parameters of AI tools, we are not going

to have AI for all. We are going to have AI for the few. This means that we need more women coding, more women programming and this is very much of a western

problem. I come from the west and in the west we haven't got women into AI. You do here and that leads me to the second thing that

pronounce it properly that Miss Punam Sharma expressed beautifully. You asked the key question. And I'm so grateful to you. You said we have the women. Do we have the power?

That is the key question because yes, it's important when women coding, but it's let me say more important to have the women at the top of company businesses, at the top of government to

decide what AI we're building and why. To me this is the crucial thing and this is why we founded women leading in AI. We work with equality now with the alliance for universal digital rights

because of that reason. Women in coding is great because women in coding can say hey you are not man you're not massaging the data enough. Hey we don't have enough

representative data therefore we may need to create some synthetically to make it more representative. But it's the top that decides that that AI has to be equitable.

It's the top that says actually manufacture it if you don't have it. It's not a programmer. So the key thing that brings us together India as all our countries in the world

is women and the fact that we've got to count in the places where it matters. I'm vice president of whipra and I realize myself how much and how important it is to be in a role where

you can lead from the front. So this AI for her initiative all this artificial intelligence and inspiration India is is greatly ready to lead and to compete on a global stage on AI. It would be

fantastic to also with this bring women along to lead all of this. So yes, more women coding, but overall the key message for me is more women deciding the policy around AI, the businesses

around AI, which tools we are going to use, who is going to benefit from them and to me this is the real change that we need. &gt;&gt; So powerful. I really love that. Do

women have the power or not? And uh you spoke about right from diversity of data to diversity of team to diversity of leadership people who are really in the position to make those big decisions for

all of us. Moving from one power woman to another. Uh Miss Spash Seel it's it's really great to see a woman in manufacturing. So so so really good to have you here. Uh, Miss Seagel is chief

growth officer at Spash CCTV where she spearheads the company's expansion and the development of next generation AI powered video intelligence solutions. She's playing a vital role in advancing

India's surveillance manufacturing and positioning the brand as a leader in global electronics and security. So, let me uh ask you a question. Um firstly uh you know uh the speed when it

comes to speed and when it comes to uh inclusion they move at different speeds. Uh today uh growth uh and the way the technology is moving is expected to move at a neck-breaking speed. However, if

you want to take everybody along and we want to create a equitable environment that takes time. How do you balance the two? Do you find it tough? Is it uh is it really a competitive edge for you

because you're building it holistically or is it a burden that you carry? &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Roma and I'm going to continue from where you know you've left it off. Um what is it that we are

building this AI for really and I'm going to give you a quick glimpse of the of the security and manufacturing industry. Um I myself am very new in the industry right as you can tell by my age

I'm very very new. Um and just last month I was at Bharat Mandeper as well and we had one of the biggest industry shows and I asked my father who's the founder of the business you know he was

discussing with the marketing team what gifts we giving out and we're big on indigenous development and so we said we'll give these pocket squares with the Indian flag on it and my first question

was okay what about the women &gt;&gt; and the team said 90% will be men they were lying 99% were men and it is amazing to see that in this industry that we are you know present in um two

weeks ago I was at another conference and it was all csos and CIOS the decision makers in the security industry I went on the stage and I was one of the five women in the room and the youngest

person there and so I would like to look at this as the root as we have to look at this as the root cause of the problem if you don't have women if you don't have young people in the industry if you

don't have young people who are giving you or women who are giving you the use cases. You don't know what the requirements are and you don't know who's building those requirements. And

so realistically inclusion only comes into play when we know who we are catering to. And this industry really does not know who we are catering to. And we're talking about the security

industry of this nation. And so I'm very proud to be sitting on the stage here today and representing a company where for us for the last 10 years the head of our product team is a woman, a dynamic

woman. The head of our AI team is a woman. 60% of our AI team is women. And it's not just on the technology side. In manufacturing, 45% of the floor is female workers in the factory. Woohoo.

And when you have representation like that, we're not sitting in the room and thinking is it AI for her or is it AI for him. We're thinking about the use cases and the practicality of that

technology. And when we think about the practicality of that technology, there are hundreds of use cases that do include women at the forefront especially when we talk about

technology. And so for us, it is a key key pillar of our growth that we take that view into account. I'll give you a quick example of the the technologies that are being worked upon. So it's not

just AI but it's also the new technologies in security industry. For example, there's something called a LAR technology where the base case for that technology is you can detect if there is

some intrusion on the railway line when the train is moving. So you don't hit someone or the train doesn't derail in fog or in you know those kind of conditions. And the first use case that

my father and I discussed was that this is a technology that can actually be deployed in women's toilets because that is somewhere you can't have CCTV camera. You cannot record somebody in a toilet.

But this is a security this is a feature that's doing heat sensing and mapping and that is when you start just intrinsically thinking about women use cases. And so for us as a business and I

think for the security industry in general, one of the biggest things to do is to make sure that that inclusion is included at the root level. Not led as AI for her or AI for him, but built into

the systems that we are creating. And so for us, it is handinand in fact I would say we will be leading the industry if we think about AI for her before we think about AI for him. And even though

it is all the same, it does make a huge huge difference in creating the security ecosystem of the nation. Thank you. That was really amazing. So inspiring to see the representation in

your company. I'll move towards my left now. Uh uh Miss Sharma you know is uh the Piki Eloh president but she's also a distinguished entrepreneur in the field

of health and wellness sector. uh she leads the Virangana Foundation which focuses on uplifting women in Budil Bud Khil Kant by providing uh skill development medical aid healthcare

services to underprivileged community. It was really inspiring to hear the uh two panelists who just spoke and you know role models have played an important role like you. I come from a

non technology background right I studied sciences in my graduation and started my career with banking and the last 10 years I have immersed myself in technology and I also realized the value

that I bring uh because of the differentiated experience that I have had. Now you gave us really powerful stats. It was very very encouraging to see. There are many initiatives that uh

Fiki Fellow is leading as as we speak. What are some of the key ones that come comes to your mind when it comes to say mentorship, role modeling, uh providing say AIEL uh tooling uh for PE uh for

women uh participation? Uh would you like to share some of those? &gt;&gt; Thank you Roma. So a lot of them I mean in uh a small way I have said it uh while I was there and I so 16,000 women

working like I said power to empower other women and other women at all three levels which is the grassroot level the middle class level and the upper echelons of society. So it's not that

the upper echelons of society are better off many way in uh AI or any other thing and so we have started these programs and like I said I have started uh women in tech so initially I said I didn't

know what I would do but then I have such talented women all over the country who have put their minds together we've all sat together and of course they are very technologically uh forward also

they are into this line so let me read out some of the things because there is so much work. Um so some things I've talked about I've talked to you about uh the conclaves that we've done for person

like me I went to inaugurate the conclave the Bangalore chapter was doing it the ones in Delhi I had uh organized so Bangalore was together with the center and I thought okay it's a whole

day I have to listen to things I can't tell you I came out so excited out of that with knowledge so just hearing even the talks or meeting people or hearing them. You don't have to be a tech

warrior to be in this uh field like we are listening to you and I hope this is forwarded uh many times to a lot of people and women especially we will take it up in all our Vicki uh flow the

conversations that itself was empowering just understanding realizing that you can be techsavvy it is not that difficult small steps that we are taking it is going to make a difference so just

a little bit things which I might have missed out apart from the uh and the national digital uh literacy campaign we do at home through uh like I said even at the grassroot and uh at uh the middle

class depending on uh and the operational how do they uh digitalize how they work these women who make how do we put them on Instagram how do we connect them to markets and so so every

kind of woman because we leave no woman behind on every kind of woman that is My motive for the year leave no woman behind. They are entrepreneurs, they are soloreneurs, they are uh um homereneurs

and or they want to be prreneurs. Everybody's in our ambit. So we digital uh uh we do future tech frontiers. We are training startups and with wise uh startups and Msmemes we their uh tech uh

they are little small tech companies. There's one lady from Kashmir. It was so nice to see never thought that uh from Kashmir a small part of Kashmir and she has come in a burkha and everything a

little uh you know but still she was wanted to learn and she came on online and she's being mentored through our uh systems which is uh center of excellence we have started for future skills by

introducing robotics like I said drone and so for example um Amritser one of the chapters so of course Bangalore or Chennai all these are doing I talked about uh you know what we're training in

tinkering labs at mission we've talked about all these we've done that but a small example of how Amritser the ladies did never never went to a village they come from uh the city have gone and

trained these a small number maybe not 300 as Bangalore did but a small number and I see the changes coming they said how will we do it punam I said connect with so and so connect with so and so

connect with so and so in your area they will help you and they did it they managed and they are very proud of it and I'm very proud of them every small change um is a uh pride for me

generative AI workshops like in Chennai that we've done to ensure that they enter the work force tech ready we've also tied up with flexibbees so there are women in tech especially because of

marriage or because of shifting places or because of having children or taking care of the elders. A lot of these women have studied science, have gone into tech but they cannot come back once two

year gap or few year gap they take coming back into this workforce uh tech workforce is so important. So we have these bounceback courses for them you know so we are doing that and we are

connecting them to flexibes again we had a tie up so these are few examples I'm giving you there's a lot of work in and there's just eight months of this work and uh so we tie up that while you are

at home while you're doing all this while you're unable to come out you can keep connecting learning and doing some part-time things in the same industry so that you're connected because this

industry moves fast these are some of the few words that we can. &gt;&gt; Thank you. That's that's really a lot of work in just a short span of eight months. That's brings me to Sarah Camp.

Sarah Camp is the vice president of international government affairs at Indel. She has also served as the deputy under secretary for the international trade administration at the US

Department of Commerce and brings with her decades of global policy u expertise. So S I've been really really keen to explore many topics with you. Let's see how much we can uh cover

today. Uh but do bring in everything that you feel is uh is relevant to this uh conversation. Now when we talk about funding and these uh you know analytics that work they can get into loop. So do

you see AIEL analytics helping in terms of picking up the right areas for investments and also beyond funding what are some of the things that uh you have learned from your decades of expertise

in uh working in policy uh that that will help in moving women from being consumers and users to really creators of AI as a technology. No, thank you and thank you for having this session. I

want I'm going to echo some of the things you've already heard. So my answer is it depends. It's up to us, right? If we use design thinking, if we're intentional if we with what we do,

if we look at the data, if we understand the biases that the data brings, then yes, AI can either disrupt the status quo as it exists, or we can just double down and embed it into the future.

Right? And I'm going to start with with a with a data point, right? Because it's about AI. Um, when you look at men and women doing startups, they start up at about the same rate. In technology, if

you look at venture capital, global venture capitalist funds for the technology sector. Anyone know what percentage of those funds goes to women le tech startups? Anybody?

&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm guessing not 50%. &gt;&gt; 2%. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. 2%. &gt;&gt; That's really really

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, we have a unique opportunity to disrupt that. But it goes to what you've said, right? What's the data behind it? Who is in the room that is designing the AI systems and

designing the governance? When you have women, and it's not just about women. When you have a diverse group, you get better outcomes. You figure out the biases up front. You get better

products. So we need to really double down on who is actually going to lead AI governance and my question to all of you in this audience is in your companies what are you doing to ensure there's

diversity on your AI governance every company should be thinking about this question we also have to besides recognizing the biases which is critically important and they have to be

within a cultural context right because you can't just take data from the best and import it into a country like India and expect it to work. That that's crazy. Um so we have to ensure that

we're not just identifying the biases but we're looking them in a cultural context and then we're addressing them right with I would say gender agnostic and genderneutral metrics that value

startups that focus on objective data right why don't you look at the cost of a customer lockin the cost of acquiring a customer interesting fact when venture capitalists interview men and women

startups in the tech sector they ask women what's your risk policy, how do you address risk? And they ask men, what's your growth policy? What are you doing to promote growth? Right? That

inherently biased questions leads to different outcomes. We can change that. Um, I also want to very quickly talk about something completely different, which is it's not just about access to

capital, it's about access to capability. We have to start training women. Yes. What we see at Intel is if we do not work with women and girls before the age of 11, it is so much

harder to get them into STEM and to the point of we have to bring them along which means there has to be access from everything from my question to everyone in this room. When you look at who has

access to the laptops at home, is it the boys or is it the girls? Who's got access? Right? So, we need to really think comprehensively about what we're doing to be able to bring belonging. I

love what you talked about creating a sense of belonging for women and girls in terms of technologists that there's a community for them, there's shared spaces for them, there's access, right?

Um, and it's access to opportunities and to um equipment for sure and and data sets, but we have to look at it holistically. So, let me just stop there.

Thank you so much Sara that uh start of 2% was so heartbreaking. There's so much for us to uh do uh as uh as we move forward. Now last but not the least we have Sya Wasi. She's the vice president

and India hub CTO at Shender Electrics. A visionary technology leader, Sanda is fostering future ready research and development transformation and accelerating the culture of innovation

within within the industry. Thank you so much uh for being here Sanda. Uh yes we have enough time for you. I was really looking forward to this question. Now in the world of energy and manufacturing

the stakes for AI are very high. How does having diverse voices in R&amp;D lead to safer and more sustainable industrial systems that will work for everyone? &gt;&gt; Great. Uh good morning everyone and uh

glad to be a part of uh today's discussion and all of us are doing wonderful job here today uh in uh putting forward our thoughts in a very very authentic manner. Uh so kudos to

everybody for doing that. So coming back to the question u I'm going to answer it in uh probably uh two two parts. Uh the first one is the stakes of AI is very high in uh every sector and also in the

energy management sector too. Uh being an energy tech leader uh Schneider Electric these are some of the challenges as well as the growth opportunities that we are seeing. couple

of things. So three things that I if I want to talk about where AI is really helping us is one over the past years if I have to talk about just the last two to three years the customer usage

pattern or we call it mission profile how a product is being used by customer is quite rapidly changing it's extremely important for our R&amp;D for our teams to understand how these trends are evolving

and what does it mean for us when you are developing a product one. The second thing is there has been an ask um from the customers in terms of how do you make my product energy efficient

energy efficient right so gone are the days where uh if you take an UPS right gone are the days where if you give 85% energy efficiency people are so happy today the customers are asking for

anything not less than 97% right and that brings me to the Third point which is everybody is looking at the nextG architectures to make all this happen. So we have three things. One is

make my product safer, make my products reliable and I want the nextg innovation. So the three things earlier we used to think that we need a trade-off between these three aspects to

to be able to better serve our customers. No, it's not going to happen. To be able to stay competitive in this market, you need to have a right balance of these three. And that is where I

would like to reiterate that AI is uh playing a very key role in terms of how well I can draw inferences from the product which is already right out there and how well I understand the you know

the customer pattern usage pattern and I will take a decisions right based on the data that has been provided to make my product energy efficient. And then the third thing is AI for design right I

mean how well we will equip our design engineers to bring in that nextgen architectures or innovations into the design. So this is a no-brainer that AI has a very high stakes in our you know

overall product development. Now having said that can we achieve all these three things uh with our just with our R&amp;D teams or just you know homogeneous teams? Absolutely no and that is where

you know the diverse thought process would come in. Everyone need to understand what is that complexity that we are in. How well each one would bring in their diverse thought process to make

these three things achievable for our customers and for ourselves. &gt;&gt; Very powerful. I'm so glad to know that we don't have to choose between uh safety, reliability and innovation and

uh you know uh thank you so much for that. Uh we have little time left. I wish we had more. We have such an interesting &gt;&gt; I'll intervene here. I think we got the

room at 10:30. So we will continue till 11:25. So you have another 7 8 minutes. Uh so we can do that show. But I think I got a ping from the organizer side that they need a group photograph because

then they'll preprint it real time and give it to all of us. So can I request the panel to give us and sorry apologies to the audience. This is a part of the thing which I got it. Can we request all

of you to please uh stand up and then they can click a photograph and then we continue with the panel for another 10 minutes. All right. I I guess that little bit of

action got our energies back. So I have one common question for all our panelists uh which is um looking forward at 2026 and beyond what is that one AIdriven breakthrough you believe will

have the most significant impact on leveling the playing field for women in the digital economy. So one most significant big breakthrough and this time I will start with Sya in the

reverse order. Uh so what is your one big thing? I think uh personalized learning I think that's one breakthrough I would I would think of personalized learning at scale definitely

personalized learning uh Sara I I would say yes and um bringing bringing compute to the edge so that everyone has access at a price point so that on your laptop if you're a student

you can do amazing things with an NPU GPU CPU which is tech talk for basically getting the compute you need where you need it when you need it because if you do that you can unlock the potential of

the future technologists in a way that's extraordinary um and a very quick story on that we um had we have a we have a a global contest last year's Indian winner for the global contest came up with an

app that you can download from the phone for one rupia for farmers and it tells the farmers where to pesticides in a very concentrated way by using GPS and wind patterns. What does that do? It

allows the farmers to increase their yield and not have their their um crops wiped out. When I asked the team why they did that, they said, "I'm from a farming community. My my community has

been devastated by suicides because of crops being wiped out, and I can make a change." You put that kind of power in the hands of future technologist to be able to do that kind of data analytics,

you are going to unleash unbelievable innovation and that's what I'm excited about. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for the powerful uh example. So compute which is affordable,

available whenever as and when required. Uh na your pick one of &gt;&gt; I'll take it up from where you said because in India the talent is immense. M

&gt;&gt; and uh the fire in the belly is immense to learn uh even if they don't understand English at grassroots because I work a lot in grassroot level and um so what we need to do is go down to two

tier or three tier because in bigger cities there are opportunities go down to these ones go down to communities go down to self-help groups maybe make u uh you know like AID we make a AI sucky

uh sorry drone AI and we have somebody who goes down to communities teaches them. So the spread is far and wide and useful like in agriculture in education in for them setting up and especially in

vernacular languages uh because a lady in Benares can go uh through AI and find out what the price of Assari in Delhi is like helping them at the grassroot level. So I would like to uh you know

see how it can be distributed uh uh at a grassroot level also it's spread &gt;&gt; taking the ma magic of AI across the length and the breadth of the country to every corner of the country that brings

me to you Ivana what's your wonderful you can take this &gt;&gt; okay I've lost my &gt;&gt; um I'm going to be a bit provocative here and I would like to see AI that

actually really benefits us because the key question that I always ask is who's benefiting here is our life actually become easier with AI as a woman you've got to what look at

yourself in the mirror and say has your life become easier please ask your question and I say this as a western woman who is doing everything online ordering stuff

and I feel I've become better on multi tasking that's right. So please look at yourself in the mirror say has my life as a woman become better. So sometimes I see these memes

on Instagram you see them as well. No and there is this this women say I want AI to do my laundry. I want a guy to clean my house. I don't want. So really especially where you know if you still

go to the doctor now and you say I feel a little bit heavy here they tell you it must be stress and it's not stress. It might be a heart attack. And the reason why they tell you stress is because

women's data have not been collected and the the the health conditions of women have not been studied. So the breakthrough is AI for women. And let me add another thing. My wish would

be that we don't call it AI for women. We call AI for all. You know why? Because women are 45 52% of the population. Yeah. So men's issue they are population's issues. women's issues,

they're women's issues. No, they are society's issue. So, I would very much to see that AI tools that make us feel better, they are AI tools for um the world, not just for women.

&gt;&gt; Again, a very powerful thought, not for her, for all all. Uh Spash, your uh one big pick. Um, I was going to say the same thing as Sarah said, so I'll have to change my answer, but on edge is

really, really important, especially when you think about a CCTV camera. You want to process everything so that quicker action can be taken, especially when it comes to security. Um, so I'm

going to say partnership because that builds on, you know, accessibility as was pointed out because partnership is so important to make sure that the entire ecosystem is tight. When we talk

about grassroot initiatives, then I even see startups and young people trying to build these technologies. Now that I'm part of the bigger industry, I see a big gap in terms of you know those

technologies actually becoming use cases and commercialization. So partnership is going to be such a key element in bringing the ecosystem together and that's where actually on edge ties as

well because we want to move away from GPUs and very very expensive systems and that's only going to promote that accessibility. So on edge and partnership

&gt;&gt; on edge and partnership and uh partnership honestly even at Google we realize that if you have to solve anything for a country of our size and our population it's not possible to do

it alone. So cheers to great partnerships going forward. Sara do you want to add do you have a pick something that you want in the AI wish list and we'll wrap up with that.

So I was actually it was a really powerful session. I would say that really fabulous one. Not that I being a women sitting with the women panel. It was the thoughts which emerge. I mean

Roba it was like I mentioned when we started it we have a tech leaders only also leading our tech committees in Viki. We have ficky flow president is a woman. Our director general is a woman.

So we understand what's the power of women. I'm not saying it just because they are holding these post. I'm talking about because of the mindset they get into the picture here like Ivana

mentioned and I completely eco those thoughts. We are not talking about men as part of the population and women as being considered separate. It's a societal thing. Please take it as part

of every damn thing which you plan it out whether it's marketing a product at R&amp;D getting it. It's very important and definitely when we talk with respect to technology we we see how AI is moving

forward. We we know the contributions of AI when we talk about our country we numbers galore I mean for the five days of the summit we are going to hear those numbers so I'm not going to be

repetitive but we talk about 500 billions by 2030 and the decades is going to be 1.5 trillion for the glo all taken what's important is how it's affecting the countries how is affecting

the population which includes men and women both and how the needs are being looked into and like uh you mentioned spurge it's about partnerships it's about getting it on the edge and of

course compute you talk about compute but it's more about getting it to the edge so that it will solve the real-time problem whether it's satisfying the customers or it's satisfying the

individuals. So for me it is like uh people making a difference and please take women just not participation take it as part of giving the direction depth and impact to the whole situation. Thank

you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Thank you so much for being a great audience. I've thoroughly enjoyed the company of these fabulous women.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much everyone. &gt;&gt; Thank you Roma and thank you all the esteemed panelists. It was really enthralling to hear all of you. Like I said, lovely to share the das with all

of you. I think the photographs would have been ready by the organizers. Are we getting that &gt;&gt; currently or five more minutes? Okay. Uh if a panel is okay should we open up for

two three minutes for one or two questions because we getting the momentos by the time by the organizers. &gt;&gt; Yeah we have another &gt;&gt; 3 minutes 11:30 gets in. Yes. Can I have

that question from you? &gt;&gt; Hello everyone. I'm uh Shri this side and thank you so much for sharing such deep insights. I represent an enterprise company named service now and I am a

gold facilitator of a global society that is called I'm remarkable. So uh uh whatever was shared today we deeply resonate because the society also talks about how we can uh inculcate in

inculcate the concept of diversity, equity and inclusion at workplaces and beyond and more importantly how we can increase that level of confidence when it comes to women and minority groups.

Right? So a recent McKenzie study study has stated in the year 2023 that companies that is in the top quartile in the gender diverse boards they have 27% of more revenue clocking in. So my

question to all of you is centered around creating pathways like you mentioned Ivana and Roma ma'am all of you mentioned that as women we have to be in the strategic board the strategic

decisions should guide the long-term impact right so my question is as an ally as a sponsor or as an advocate how can we make the AI movement less anxious for our women folks and become more

enabling for them so that they can be a part and take a seat at the table that talks about AI deployment, AI investments and a long-term view for the company. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; I have a I have a provocation if you don't mind on this based on what you were saying which uh said something really interesting when you said we men women are asked about risk and men are

asked about growth. Now we are in a unique moment because because when it comes to governance, governance is not about risk. Governance is not a tick the box compliance exercise. Governance is a

growth capability. Okay, stay with me. So what it really good to do right now is to push the narrative that governance and how we govern the deployment development of AI

is not about risk is about growth. This will bring to shift the conversation especially women because a lot of women are in risk and governance onto growth and talk about growth. This to me is

very very important. We have to stop seeing governance as compliance. It's not. It's about growth. It's about making systems that are resilient. They bring value. So to me, this is a shift

that we absolutely need to have. So I think if we are able to remain connected uh across AI governance leaders and business leaders that share this thinking and support each other I think

we can get a lot of more women talking growth in our companies and I think we desperately and absolutely need that. &gt;&gt; Hello. Hello. Yes. 9:30 &gt;&gt; 9:30 session is over please.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Next session. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. We are wrapping it up. We got it and we're giving it to you in 55

minutes only. Don't worry. We're just wrapping it up. Giving it back to you. So I think we'll wrap it up and we'll take the momentos from outside. So thank you all for being supportive and for a

nice panelist and thank you audience for being there and being supportive. Thank Hello. introduce myself. creating the met frontier ecosystem innovation towards AI enabled health for

all. I would request all to kindly space out this front area. 10:30 session is over session.

Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome back to the India AI summit and to the special plenary session on co-creating the MedTech frontier ecosystem innovation towards AI enabled

health for all. Integration of AI technology in medtech industry is changing how healthcare is delivered. It is widening access, enabling earlier and more preventive care and improving

system efficiency. But the real shift is not just technical. It is structural. It is about how innovation moves from labs to clinics, from pilots to scale and from isolated solutions to systemwide

impact. Today's discussion will focus on what is working, what is holding us back and how collaborative pathways can move move AI enable my tech innovation from ideas to real world impact not just in

India but globally. For this session please welcome on stage Dr. Ti Tangar Raju scientist F Anasadhan National Research Foundation. Request everyone to please give a big

round of applause. Mr. Gorav Vagarwal co-chairman CIA National Rentical Technology Forum and managing director in involution healthcare private limited

Mr. Kul Sakana chief product and technology officer AIG hospitals we'll also be joined by Dr. Taruna Madan Gupta and Mr. Christian Wickard in a couple of minutes and this session will

be moderated Dr. Taruna is here please welcome Dr. Dr. Tar Madan Gupta, Scientist Gian Head, Development Research Division, Indian Council of Medical Research. This session will be

moderated by Dr. Prashant Nag, Vice President, Clinical Excellence, Tata VanMG. Over to you Dr. Nag. &gt;&gt; So, uh good morning everybody. So we are over here for a session with where we

are talking about how we are co-creating the met frontier and uh we are talking of something with met which will create an AI enabled healthcare for everyone. So when we talk of healthare, healthcare

has transformed into waves not gradually but probably there are inflection points which changed everything. Antibiotics it doesn't just kill the infection it changed the survival itself. When we

talk of advent of CT and MRI they just didn't add to some diagnostic imaging it changed the whole clinical paradigm. When we talk of human genome project it just didn't decode the uh DNA and told

us that there are 30,000 genes. It gave birth to precision medicine. Right now our biggest uh frontier to fight oncology. When we talk of uh digitization in healthcare. It is not

about going paperless. It is about bringing that AIdriven healthcare or a data- enabled healthcare which is right now the soil for the whole thing. So what all I want to impress upon with

these all inflection points is that there are important components in it. What AI is bringing to MET. One is capability. So AI has proven its capability. One is

that these inflection points created their own uh regulatory and validation protocols and they force the ecosystem to change around themselves. So that is what AI and met is bringing together.

We all know that met is a fairly sized industry. Uh it's over half a trillion dollar across world and India is poised to go to $50 billion by 2030. So fairly a large size valuation but what AI can

add to it is the velocity. So what we are looking at is can it be that fuel that that it is not just incremental it is exponential and how we enable all those things how we prioritize how we

look at that we can take the models to scalability sustainability it's seamless integration to the clinical flows is something what we'll be exploring in the uh today's session

and as we have all the experts around it so we'll be looking at how can we align our research validation pilots manufacturing and seamless integration. So uh we'll take up the session uh not

waiting much we'll invite first Dr. Tangar Raju uh to talk about uh how ANRF is bringing Maha and taking things along. Yeah, very good morning to all.

&gt;&gt; Um, I'm so sorry to interrupt. Uh, before we begin, uh, can we please have a quick photo op? &gt;&gt; Request all our speakers to kindly come in front of the dice.

Thank you. &gt;&gt; Uh good morning to all. Uh I'm from Anushandhan National Research Foundation which was established in the year 2023. uh as a primary uh national funding

agency. So we are largely looking for for collaboration among the industry, academia and government departments so

that the efforts should be pulled and deliverable should be very much target oriented. Since from the inception we are introducing several programs for the uh

development overall development of R&amp;D ecosystem in the country and in that line we have introduced a program called mission for advancement in high impact areas and this is a prioritydriven

program which should be give solution focused research in the mission mode. As a mission program we have introduced earlier missions on electric vehicles and 2D materials AI for science and

engineering. In that line we have recently introduced another program strategic prioritization of medical technologies met mission in collaboration with the Indian council of

medical research and also Gates foundation. So the Maha mission is bridging trying to bridge the gap between the innovation and it should

reach the last mile in healthcare uh delivery products. As you all very much know that the world health organization has reported about 2 million different kind of medical

devices in the world market categorized in 7,000 uh generic groups and India is as of now depends on 60% of its medical devices depends on the imports which cost about

8.1 billion in the year 2324 and it is expected to increase by 50 billion in the coming years that reach 50 billion by 2030 by keeping this in mind and to reduce the imports and make country as

self-sustained. This mission was introduced with a vision that the it should give equitable access to highquality, affordable and innovative medical technologies to all

the citizens of the country and at one point of time we should be an exporter of medical technologies to the low income and middle inome countries. So that is the total uh idea of this

program. Through this program we are trying to fund the development and commercialization of indigenous technologies

which are of as I said should be high quality should be affordable and innovative. Though we are not very precisely focusing and been broadly classified in diagnostic and therapeutic

equipments, implants and assistive devices, consumables and surgical tools in vitro diagnostic tools and IML enabled point of care devices. It's not just softwares but it should give some

point of care solutions at the end. So these are the some areas we are interested and we are also thinking to foster the indigenous development of high priority high cost imported medical

technologies with a vision to reduce the cost of such equipments three to fivefold so that it will be available to the uh all the citizens of the country. The mission is also interested

in strengthening the existing infrastructures in the government supported institution and center of excellences. What we are going to do? We are going to

fund in three categories bioengineering, preclinical and clinical trials and also industry startup support. And uh this is 100% funding for the academic and research institutions and startups.

Whereas it's going to be 70% funding with the 30% contributions from the private sector. And the major targets you know we all know very well that the major critical

areas of medical technology development and marketing is the high cost market entry. This involves R&amp;D certification processes, clinical trials and marketing processes. All these makes the entry-

levelvel uh products is much costlier. So we are trying to reduce that by providing substantial funding for R&amp;D and there is also a global there is a country level you know concerned that

you know the regulatory requirements of very very stringentive but through this program and though ICMR has already started doing that through this program we are going to give much more advanced

and direct facilities to the beneficiaries of the medical tech uh mission which they can easily access the patent metra, metra, clinical network trials all these things and so that the

process of R&amp;D to technology transfer will be made easier than what is be considered as the constraint and also we are planning to give expert and industry advisers how to make the supply chain to

be ensured for the technologies developed during this process and there is also a deeper concern about the lack of coordination among academicians, technologist, healthcare professionals

and industry and through this mission we ensure we are planning to ensure that all of them come in one platform and provide the solutions. So this was somehow achieved in by seeing the

applications we have received for this call. This mission this was already achieved. the people are joined together in submitting the proposals and I also request you know there should be a

striking balance between the technological advancement and longevity of the products which we are planning to develop because the healthcare industry is not ready to change the equipments

now and there by investing larger money. So the products which we are aiming should be in a position that it should be upgradable in the nature. So that the investments will be cons will not be a

constraint for adopting the new and apart from all these things you know government of India is already introduced a 1 cr fund for the through RDI fund where industries are going to

get benefited with the low rate income interest low interest grants for uh it's not a grant it's a loans for the uh devel developing the industries in all the sectors, sunrise sectors especially

and in addition to that now recently DSR which is recognizing the private R&amp;D units is also given an another advantage. Usually the R&amp;D recognition will be given to the startups and

industries after 3 years of their existence. But we have now removed that class and you can get the recognition in the beginning only. So it gives an advantage that you could able

to apply for met grants or the RDI fund and all. This totally removed that three-year blockage which was earlier given to the biotech industries. Now it was introduced

to all the deep tech industries also. This is not restricted to but to the major sectors like metag advanced robotics, semiconductors, electronics and a and IoT and other relevant areas.

So the ecosystem currently in the country is much much favorable. I request uh all of us join together to make use of the system and uh make India self-sufficient in developing the

medical devices. Thank you. &gt;&gt; It was really great uh Dr. Raju to know the way you Maha is bridging the gap between the innovation the last mile uh although you touched upon but would like

to know more about uh how the key recent changes in DSR registration because that is something which is not simple for uh the new tech companies. So if you can elaborate on that.

&gt;&gt; Yes you know the DSR recognition for private R&amp;D institutions will be given after 3 years of their existence. they should show their R&amp;D capabilities and demonstrate their products. After that

only they are becoming eligible to apply for getting those R&amp;D recognition. But now we removed the three-ear blockage from any industries or any startups especially which are incubated in the uh

parks innovation parks and all they can readily apply since from the beginning so that they'll get the R&amp;D recognition which gives them an added advantage in applying for these grants and also they

are will get you know there is import uh custom duty clearances charges will be reduced. So there are financial and also other benefits are expanded through this recognition.

&gt;&gt; Great. Really great to know. So we'll move forward. Uh we'll invite Dr. Tuna to please enlighten Dr. TA is a scientist with ICMR and uh we like to understand deeper how the what are the

clinical uh real challenges to get a clinical grade solutions in met. uh thank you so much for that opportunity and uh to contribute to this session on uh uh ecosystem innovation

towards AI enabled health for all and as you rightly said that Indian council of medical research is the apex body for the country in medical research and the clinical evaluation is our mandate. So

clinical evaluation of medical devices in a regulation compliant manner is our mandate to be precise. So for that we are making various various uh uh we are taking various initiatives as uh Dr.

Tanga mentioned that the first initiative that we took was uh that we need to have some standards for the data sets that we have because based on those data sets only the AI tools can be

developed. So that was the first step taken by ICMR and uh if you happen to see the website of our uh institute in Chennai which is on tuberculosis research we call it as ITRC or uh Indian

tuberculosis research institute. So that institute has put in more than 10,000 curated X-ray images for TB affected individuals in different stages as well as the annotation has been done for

these images and we also have healthy control X-rays along with that so that the AI tools can be developed based on this data set and people are using that data set and already uh there is a CXR

uh enabled AI tool which is being onboarded by the health ministry based on that data and that has been developed by an NGO in uh uh Gujarat. So that was the first thing and the second step was

to move even further higher for the oncology databases for the breast cancer for gloma. So what we have done is we tied up with Indian Institute of Sciences Bangalore and the Art Park

which is one of the uh uh startups there and these agencies together have created gold standard data sets for these oncology. Uh so these data sets are already on boarded by MIT. So these are

accessible to all the uh uh people who want to develop AI based prediction diagnosis algorithms uh for uh these two cancers and this is the process is going on. We are still uh you know supporting

these agencies to work work further. So this is one aspect. The second aspect what we are doing is we created medtech mitra and patent mitra. So the metitra is a portal where any met innovator wi

with respect to whatever they are developing at any stage of development from TRL1 to TRL8 uh from ideation to the product uh you know upscaling. So we are there to support them. So this is a

uh structure on which is a single window system. In fact, minister sir, honorable health minister sir had very nicely coined that this is the met highway. It's not metra. It's a highway where

people when they are developing met innovations, they fall into the death valleys. And those valleys of death are the challenges that they face during the uh uh course of their product

development. And the most important value of death is regulation because they do not understand what regulation they have to follow. And this is a major challenge for the AI tool development.

And we have the regulators on board. We have joint drug controllers both on medical devices and diagnostics both sitting on board and giving one-on-one advice to each and every innovator who

reaches out. So we are now uh completing two years and with two years we have more than 900 innovators who have joined us uh for getting advice. After that the major step is the

preclinical evaluation as well as so for AI tools definitely there is no preclinical evaluation but the clinical evaluation is a must and for the clinical evaluation we do have ICMR

guidelines for the AI tools for healthcare as well as we are helping them in developing the clinical evaluation protocols and the centers where these tools can be evaluated. So

we have center for advanced research more than 30 center for advanced research are there and we have an intent network Indian clinical trial and education network which has more than 84

clinical trial sites across the country and we do have characteristics of these trial sites on the basis of uh that what is the population that they cater to. For example, we have sites which are uh

c catering to malaria. We we have sites which are catering to uh entroviral diseases which is like polio. We have uh as I mentioned the sites for tuberculosis. So these are sites which

have very defined uh participant clientele to which on which this AI tool can be uh evaluated and developed further and they will be also enabling them in designing the protocol the study

protocol in a regulation compliant manner so that these studies and the results are acceptable to the CDSO so that they can get the marketing license from them. So this is the whole guidance

we give at MedTek Mitra. The patent mitra is ICMR's cost. Any met innovator beat industry or academia can just write to us and we beer the whole cost for patenting and maintaining that patent

for 5 years including uh search for the patentability including the legal support for the patentability and drafting the patent in such a manner that it is infringement. uh secure. So

this this is another support system that we have at ICMR. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Really great to know the way the gap between innovation and regulation is being filled. Uh the trial frameworks

you guys have created uh that will be definitely a big enabler and really interesting to know that all the infective focus like TB, malaria, all these things are being covered. The data

sets which are required for our nation. It is not something which we are just borrowing it from somewhere and taking strides on ancology. Uh really great to know ma'am. Uh anything uh you like to

add on the adaptive AI systems trial frameworks? Are there clear guidelines on these uh eight stages? Uh so uh very pertinent question and this is a process ongoing. We do not

have very structured frameworks. The most important thing is that CDSO has come out with special guidelines for AI tools for healthcare. The draft guidelines were uh published in October

and they are uh collecting informations and suggestions from the stakeholders various stakeholders including ICMR and then this there will be a final guideline set that will be available for

the country and that will be catering to all the structured frameworks. Thank uh really great to know the rigor with which uh patient safety and data is being taken care of in this fastmoving

AI world. Uh now from innovation to regulation now moving to the industry side. Uh we'll like to know the views of uh Mr. Garav on the impactful AI implications. U I think uh Dr. Dr. Gorav

is a known uh face in MET world and CI placeholder also. So we like to know how impactful AI implications are on Indian MT world. Thank you very much uh for that introduction. Delighted to be on

this panel and uh really wonderful to know the initiatives that ANRF and uh ICMR are taking in in enabling a AIdriven MET frontier. So from a metric standpoint as we make the transition

from volume to value I think it's extremely important that we interpret AI at least I personally interpret AI in three different ways. So for me medtech is nothing if it's not advanced

accessible and available especially in the Indian Indian context. So I see this as advanced yet indigenous AI accessible and innovative available and impactful. So that's my definition from a medtech

context of AI. Coming close to home, um I think AI and manufacturing especially in medtech and this is a very important area because today India has nearly 13,000 registered manufacturers of

medical devices with an average size of about $5 million. So size and scale is an issue. Now how can AI help size and scale? you know wherever AI can bridge manpower gaps in access

uh for example if you talk about uh diagnostic tools you know AI can be a great triage for X-rays you know tuberculosis cardiac diseases it not only cuts down the processing time by 70

to 80%. But it also improves productivity in tier 2 and tier three cities. I think it's pertinent to note that India as startling as it may sound has only 22 radiologist per million

population. US in comparison has 200 radiologist per million population. So it's extremely important that AI enhances speed, improves productivity.

Now the second area where I think AI can impact met is smart variables. You know today you have uh ECG patches, you have uh smart variables, you have continuous glucose monitoring devices delivering

hyper precise, hyper localized, hyperpersonalized real-time diagnostics. I think that with a 200 million patient population suffering from diabetes and 80 million patients suffering from

cardiovascular disease, I think that is a great enabler you know. So another diagnostic and uh triage tool. The third area is I think treatment planning where AI workflows are playing a very

important role in neuron navigation for example they can make surgeries a lot more precise they can create workflows for surgical robotics which are extremely important for precision and

safety coming to my personal area cardiology you know in cardiology there is a very interesting study I'd encourage you to Google it and it is published in

nature's one of the most respected journals which says that diagnosis of eco cardiography made by cardiologists versus AI the chances of rejection are only 17% with AI and

28% with cardiologists. So it's not only improving the speed, it's improving the prognosis as well. You know, also if you take an example of a very recent startup

called Super Health. Now Super Health has has completely created a new paradigm for healthcare delivery. They've created something called a complete tech stack called Super OS. A

total operating system. Traditionally what happens is that you have softwares that are laid over an existing hospital information system. They have a complete tech stack which is an operating system

which reduces human intervention. Now how is this important in in the context of healthcare delivery? It delivers hyperprecise medicine. It creates agentic AI workflows. It reduces the

appointment time by dynamically adjusting physician and patient schedules. It also brings in transparent pricing. You know, they do not differentiate. AI

does not differentiate between a CT for hand and a leg. Why should it be charged differently? So, I think the frontiers of what AI can conquer and do in healthcare delivery and medtech is is

evolving very rapidly and personally very excited. Yeah, really great to know and uh witnessing it from the clinical side, it's really uh simply enrling uh the way

things are changing. uh one important point you being on the industry side what is the critical barrier which still as an nation we have to think on when we we are looking at uh a particularly in

met Dr. Terna briefly touched upon it access to high quality data sets for a nation of 1.4 4 billion people you know we do not have regulated anonymized large

patient data sets which form food for any model right in medte especially machine learning algorithms are more relevant than AI tools themselves and the reason for that is uh you know first

there is no large data sets that are regulated and second the clinical validation is very hard you know You develop a data set, you develop a tool, prognostic, diagnostic, therapeutic and

then how do you deploy it? And for us as industry, it's extremely hard to monetize any AI tool or software in India. I mean, I have a a hospital chain, large

hospital chain seated next to me. You know, you can upsell your solution. You can upsell a CT or an MR or a Kathl, but you can't monetize a software solution by itself. You know so that's a problem.

Hospitals do not recognize and reward innovation. So unless there is a revenue model inbuilt as they say charity is not scalable. You know that is another limiting factor. Industry is not

rewarded for innovation. And third and the most important is regulatory and procurement barriers. I touched upon it. The regulations for software as a medical device are still

work in progress. Dr. Katna mentioned it. You know, it is evolving very rapidly. But what is also happening is that a lot of seed funding happens at the proof of concept stage and then

large series A and series B investors need to look at validated ready to deploy solutions for which you need clinical validation and there you create a 3 to5 million funding gap. I think

that can be very very succinctly uh bridged by agencies like ANRF. So those are some of the challenges that I foresee. Very well put. Uh exactly the journey

from in idea to uh scale is something which really needs uh next level push. So uh moving ahead with the discussion uh we'll like to move to Mr. Christian. Uh Mr. question is an uh global digital

policy uh guy from Merc would like to understand uh from you how global digital policies evolving around AI and met and how do you feel India where do India stand in all this

&gt;&gt; thanks so much for the opportunity thank you all for being here um yeah so AI policy is evolving incredibly fast right so trying to catch up with the technology

Um and the result is really that the topic is extremely complex. So the US for example, the US where I'm based uh changed its approach, right? President Biden had one approach and

this year President Trump changed it trying to reduce some of the uh regulatory aspects of it trying to innovate a little bit more keeping uh safety uh in mind and having a national

institute focusing on that Europe is also changing so they started uh uh talking about the UI act and it's already under review now with the digital omnibus was even before getting

in force. It was going in for the high-risk uh aspect of it was going to enter into force now in August. Um so this shows that uh policy is really changing incredibly fast and it's having

difficulty to catch up with the technology. So when the U AI act conversation started um we're talking about some AI applications, devices etc. Then you had the CHP moment and

everything changed and they created a new chapter on that in the parliament in the last minute. Now you have agentic AI and the conversation changes. you have agents embedded in the device, maybe an

agent uh taking care of the patient or working with the patient groups, agents uh with the hospital and the devices and the ecosystem will will talk and add just layers of complexity. Um so I

believe the main message and policy makers are understanding it is that you need uh flexibility. You need to have the principles, the ethical guidelines, the outcomes you want to get out of it

and and keep adapting, have postmarket uh surveillance, keep that feedback loop, improving everything. Um and when I think about India, I can trace a similar path. uh maybe it was less

regulated before 2017 increased some of the regulation but it's also adapting trying to find solutions and I believe uh India and many of the global south countries can contribute in

the sense of bringing different perspectives. So if the US is having difficulty, if Europe is having difficulty trying to understand where the technology is going, uh some

tangible applications like here can become the example and influence the conversation. What is important to do that? Join the conversation. Show the examples, the projects that are uh uh

getting results. Make sure that the regulation allow them allow those solutions to interact in public private partnerships with folks in other countries. So I don't want to extend too

much but that's a a general idea. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh so great to know Christian. So you are talking of u how India can harmonize uh in this whole uh the new challenges which the whole world is

facing out and can India shape it uh for the world rather than just following them. Yeah, we understand that we you do have a scale we have data sets but uh at policy level how do you feel that with

this the very policy maker is getting uh bound to their own geographies. So what is the path to harmonize? How to take it to next level from your lens when you are looking at uh different markets

internationally? &gt;&gt; Very good. So the first uh element of harmonization in our opinion is really the ethical approach. So when we see a new regulation worldwide, we step back

and decided to no mer has to have its own approach. So we have a code of digital ethics uh developed with academia. it's published. We then established a digital

ethics advisory panel uh and all relevant projects that we have and we have many around AI with different partners will go through this panel to understand what's at risk. So if you

have that foundation whatever regulation comes you know okay how how will I adhere to that well if you have the right principles somehow you are aligned um same thing for data and for the

solutions we invested a lot in quality data sets solutions like cynthrop is a company that we launched uh um to facilitate researchers to have access to data control their data internationally

as well. Um so I believe that's how you harmonize you know sharing with security with privacy the data sets collaborating in an ethical level involving multiple stakeholders

um that will get you to the results you want. So &gt;&gt; yeah very good. &gt;&gt; Yeah well put. So it's all about uh understanding the foundation and then

stepping back putting everything at one place and then thinking about uh global outreach. Great to know. So we'll move uh ahead in our discussion to Kenjel who is a chief product and technology

officer and a passionate technology guy working with AIG hospitals. Uh so Kel uh since you're already in a clinical market you have seen um we had a side discussion he has worked with fintech

and all we would like to understand how do you feel that AI can augment workflows in hospitals how ready our clinical structure is on this all AI medtech

&gt;&gt; uh uh thank you so much uh thanks for having me here uh uh it's a very important point because uh the way hospitals think about artificial intellig igence in healthcare is very

different from uh how manufacturers and how regulators think about it. Uh as Dr. Turona and Gorov mentioned that there is a regulatory nuance and then there is a ROI or procurement nuance. At hospital

we see a completely different nuance which is adoption nuance. So even though a metec device or an AI algorithm is approved from a regulatory standpoint and the manufacturer has also taken all

the respective or guard rails to ensure that it is manufactured properly and stays by all the all the right parameters. When this algorithm and device is handed

over to a doctor, you're really asking him to drive a self-driving car and not sleep behind the wheels because the doctor says that if I have

to really look at all the tests by myself because at the end it is the doctor who is responsible for the outcome for the clinical outcome. So the perspective that clinicians come with is

if I have to anyways do it then what is the benefit I'm getting? That's the big question that everybody need to answer and that's where uh after regulatory approval after met and

one of the biggest uh point that Gorov mentioned is they don't see an ROI for the for the software because the doctor says that I'm I have to be responsible now in order to make that successful and

at AIG hospitals we have been able to make it successful in some of the areas is we need three very important changes which is process technology ology and people I'll give an example many

algorithms that are in the market today all of them or most of them are trained on western data so the trust factor for those even though they are mostly FDA approved is very less for the clinicians

now in order to make that work there are some advanced technologies which are also available uh and as a manufacturer will agree with is they need a specialized scope some standard level of

scopes uh or the machines on which these algorithms truly work at the required level of efficiency. So one is the technology in itself need change. We talk about agentic AIs we talk about

scribes doctor patient consultation converting into automatic uh consultation notes etc etc but you need good mics to be placed which are all extra cost for hospitals.

Coming to the people aspect when the doctors say that if anyways I have to look at the result the point which is important is earlier they were spending 20 minutes to look at

the result and now they only need five. Every clinician respects and appreciates this fact. But it is extremely important to have uh person in the loop or expert in the

loop for any AI algorithm or AI metek to be applied in a hospital setting. And if we are doing that I think this is extremely important for the regulators and for the met to do is how we can get

that expert in the loop involved in right from the beginning itself and that's why u that is an additional investment also that is required uh to ensure that while the clinician

themselves don't look at it someone else who is an expert is looking and verifying and approving on be on their behalf and that would be an acceptable outcome which will significantly improve

the adoption. in the hospitals or in clinical settings. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh can relate to it uh from my medical background. Yes, this is very

very important. Uh so what we can see is that there is a journey of clinical deployment, the legal responsibility of the doctor, the real outcome, the real ROI for the person who is investing and

the ROI in terms of time, ROI in terms of efficacy, ROI in terms of efficiency. So well put so if I just uh take it one step you took all the part from the hospital and doctor side do you feel

there will be a trust barrier from the patient side also &gt;&gt; definitely yes I mean I would never have I mean I I personally even though I'm a big evangelist of artificial

intelligence myself I would not take a prescription which is prescribed by AI itself because it completely depends on what data is being fed to the algorithm um so uh and and we have seen

uh the very first thing comes from privacy itself. So we at uh AIG hospitals and a lot of large hospitals are actually using uh scribes which is doctors and patients they have lost the

eye to eye contact. When you go to a doctor's office you would like the doctor to look at you and not keep typing and unfortunately most doctors type with two fingers. So uh so then

then you want that eye to eye contact and for that we have bought these uh patient doctor consultation automatically converting into consultation note. The first thing that

the patient gets comfort uncomfortable is they are talking something very private and somebody's listening to it. The second piece is if somehow suddenly some medication is being prescribed and

I'll give you I would like to give an example. We have implemented something which is called as AI powered discharge summary creation. Now when that happens

all the electronic medical record that is there in the system in a few seconds the discharge summary gets created which is the biggest problem in any discharge process in any hospital you give. So we

created it we implemented it. The biggest challenge that we saw is once that started happening, the doctors eventually minimized looking at the out the true

discharge summary which is being given to the patient and that resulted into patient saying did it really happen to me because there was some amount of hallucinations in the algorithm.

So these things do create problems. Agreed. Agreed. And this agent hallucinations is something which we all come place every day and with charge. So I know we are running short of time. So

we'll like to wrap up fast with the last question. Everyone can just put their views on 10 15 seconds. As India are we overindexing on innovation but underinvesting on validation?

If you can start on this. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you. So uh can you just reiterate underinvesting on &gt;&gt; uh validation &gt;&gt; and over

&gt;&gt; investing on innovation? &gt;&gt; Uh to a certain extent yes but the idea is that we are now moving ahead as I said that CDSO is coming with a special guidance for AI in healthcare and then

ICMR is revising their own guidances that we have. We are building those data sets. So yes, we are putting uh you know equally in both the arms innovation as well as validation. The 84 clinical site

trial sites I mentioned and more than 30 center for advanced research. The IITs are a center for excellence for innovation but their evaluation. So what we did was we invested first in the

center for excellence in the IITs. We got more than 30 technologies developed including AI based technologies and then now we have invested into the center for advanced research which are evaluating

them as per the guidelines as per the regulation. So it is equally we are distributing our efforts equally and more so if you happen to hear the announcement that uh our honorable

finance minister had made we are going to have more than thousand clinical trial sites and this will include evaluation of medtech including the AI based devices. So this is what we are uh

our mission is and clinical evaluation is part of the validation. So the first step is evaluation and then ICMR also supports validation in case you have done an independent evaluation and now

your product is already approved but as rightly said hospitals and patients do not have trust because you have just tested it in some hospital-based area. If you want your tool to be evaluated in

the primary healthcare, it has to be evaluated there. So we have more than 170 medical colleges and rural health research centers of ICMR where we do this field feasibility evaluation and

that is our validation program for that. &gt;&gt; Really great to know uh and really thrilled on what journey our country is going on. We are pivotal, we have data, we have scale, we have frugal innovative

abilities. So we are bound on a great journey. short of time. So, we'll like to wrap up and we'll like to invite Gates Foundation to do a closing remark on it.

&gt;&gt; Good afternoon everyone. Can you hear me? Okay, great. Uh my name is Shamashrias. I'm here on the behalf of Gates Foundation. Um first of all really really commend the time the valuable

time and insights all our esteemed speakers um have spared here. Um I'll uh say a couple of uh things. One is uh we have a fair variety of stakeholders uh on the panel but still there are many

many types of stakeholders that are not represented here. So the thing is about incentives. How do we structure the ecosystem thinking in mind what are the incentives for everybody involved? We

heard from our government uh representatives but again mostly from the research um and financing and we heard from private sector but again very established players and we are not

really uh have not heard on this panel about the frugal innovators the small uh and medium-sized uh players. We have the society at large. So when we talk about incentives, you have the tangibles and

you have the intangibles. The tangibles are profit, business continuity, disease burden, uh out-ofpocket expenditure. So these are the big tangible incentives or disincentives that we need to talk

about. Then there are intangibles. I mean I think it was going a certain way and then u Mr. Kel actually brought the reality of it from a patient perspective. Trust is such a big

intangible but kind of makes or breaks any technology and so it's really important to have a strong communication. So while this platform is on the backdrop of a AI summit I think

these conversations are much needed on a frequent basis. uh and so that's my cue to actually thank and implore CI and other similar organizations to bring stakeholders from different types uh and

and get them to a common forum so that people can hear what each other you know challenges are because these challenges will be you know filled like we did not have ANRF a few years back but today we

do so it's not only technical expertise rigor but also financing uh the way ICMR is coming up with standardization of guidelines. The way it is able to navigate uh innovations from TRL 3 to

five or 3 to six which is really the value of death is unheard of if you spoke like 15 20 years back but in 5 years it will be something different. So we really need to have a continuous uh

dialogue and so the imploration is to CI to continue uh to to do this um you know bridging of collaborators and communicate more effectively. Uh so with that thank you and u I'm now I'm

standing between you and lunch. So have a great rest of the day and the rest of the summit. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thanks everyone. It was really a great uh discussion. Looking forward for

AI powered Matte India. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Dr. Dr. Nag and all our panelists and also Miss uh Das uh I would request uh Dr. Nag to kindly felicitate our fellow panelists these

um to Dr. Tangar Raju &gt;&gt; Dr. Tarana Madan Gupta &gt;&gt; Mr. Goraval Mr. Christian Wickard and Mr. Kjul Sakana I would also request

to Goro Vagraal to quickly felicitate our moderator M Dr. Dr. Prashant now please and with that thank you everyone for joining us for this session co-creating of Medex Frontier Ecosystem

all thank you start off by saying that we have uh a session this is all about people's AI and you'll hear mostly about what we will talk about through the

conversations we are going to have. I always like starting with a little story. So I'll start with a story and then I'll invite our uh guests so you so you get a context of what AI Kiran is

what we are doing. Uh this is one of my favorite story of uh a car that gets stuck and uh they need some help and uh so they have a old donkey that's walking by with another old guy and the guy says

I'll help you with getting the car out. And the owner is kind of like this is like one old donkey and an old man. What can you guys do to help me? He says don't worry about it. And then they tie

the donkey to the car and the guy starts, this old man starts saying, "Come on, Ram. Come on Behim. Come on, Santo. Come on." Like he keeps saying these names. And uh, you know, voila, 2

minutes later, the car is out. And this guy is like, "How did this, first of all, why are you yelling all these names even though there's one donkey? And how did this puny little donkey get the car

out?" And the guy says, "Look, the donkey is blind. It doesn't know what's going on when I say all these names. It thinks there are five other donkeys pulling the car. It doesn't even know

its own strength. And he pulled it out because he thinks all these other donkeys are there to help it. So the point of the story is that we are as strong as who we believe is with us.

They don't even need to be with us. Who we believe is with us. And for us at AI Kiran, we are very lucky. We don't need to believe. We actually have people with us. So we are not quite blind. We can

actually see that a lot of people are with us. So let me tell you a little bit about what AI Kiran is and tell you who the cast of characters are who are going to be uh part of this. So AI Kiran is an

initiative that was launched by OptimizeJo and in global foundation along with the principal scientific advisor office. We've been hearing about AI forever, right? You know, I mean,

people in the technology field have been working uh at it for the last 30 years or so. But with Chad GPT, it's become everybody's buzzword, AI. But with AI, we have an amazing opportunity that

nobody has thought about so far clearly. One is with the industrial revolution, we created a lot of environmental problems in the world with the internet revolution and social media. etc. I

think we created an amazing way to connect with one another but we also created a lot of ants lot of I'm not the coolest person here I'm sort of not happening here I'm not the one happening

and everybody's having a great time and somebody said that everybody is successful on LinkedIn everybody is happy in uh uh Facebook and everybody's cool on Instagram but what is it behind

that you know with AI It's a new revolution. We have an amazing opportunity to take everyone along. I think one of the things that happened with the previous revolutions was either

they were for the elite or they were for only few. But now we have an opportunity to take everyone along. And what is everyone? Everyone is people who has whose voices have not been heard. So at

AI Kiran our whole goal is to create an inclusive AI universe where we started with women. We said a lot of women should be part of it. Then we said youth then we have now someone saying hey how

about senior citizens how about uh differently aabled. So this is a platform where we want to bring together all the people who are working in all these different areas be it rural or

urban etc. And we have people with us today who are going to explain and discuss with us what they are doing in these different areas. With that I would love to invite our uh partners Madu

who's with next wealth. We have Yash who's with Anita to house of Anita Dongre. We have sorry one second I want to make sure I get everybody. We have Ravi who's with Mentor cloud and what

they do you'll find out through the organization. I don't want to spend time explaining. And of course we have Ria who's with Uditi Foundation. Please join me on the stage and we'll have a great

conversation and you can ask questions at the end please. &gt;&gt; Oh photo. Okay. Group photo first. Okay. actually I have to say that it is kind of you know one of the most awkward

times in any con any panel is standing here and taking picture where everybody's looking at you but you know what they're doing something very cool at this conference I have to acknowledge

it up front they take this picture and by the time the session at least sit down while I talk um by the se by the time the session is over they actually have this photograph as a momentto all

the speakers I think it's like one of the coolest things that this is the way to use technology to do something so it's very very cool what they're doing so I really want to acknowledge for uh

thinking about that and um so with that I also have to uh on a lighter note you've noticed how I don't stand behind the podium I stand here the reason is I am the unofficial ambassador of Assari

in this world. So I want you all to notice how beautiful Indian sari is and that's why I always stand and talk so you all notice it. Now I can sit down. So as I said we have amazing partners.

Everyone here is part of our journey. Uh and they've all been working at this for many many years. And the beauty of this is that with this advent of AI, we are able to all work together and get much

farther faster. So I want to start with you uh Madu and uh Madu is part of next wealth organization and they have been an amazing partner and they they're really changing the lives of young

people old people like me also uh in especially in rural areas because one of the things that's very important in India is we have an urban rural divide and so what

can we do so people don't have to leave their homes and go to the city and work on things etc. But really stay so tell us a little bit about what we are do what you're doing and also how you're

participating in the AI ecosystem. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much Lakmi. Uh first of thanks for uh inviting me to be part of this panel and with the great people that we have over here from all

the way from Silicon Valley to the world of uh you know foundations to the world of fashion. So thanks so much for allowing me to be a part of this. So uh yeah, like you mentioned at we at Next

Wealth, we are uh focused on creating employment in small towns. So today we have about 5,000 employees across 10 different locations all in uh what would be considered tier three, tier four

towns. Uh 60% of our workforce is women. Uh we work with various multinational companies essentially helping them make uh AI real in the practical in the real world. So uh essentially where our uh

intersection with AI comes is we uh were founded while we were founded as a social impact employment creation oper uh organization. Uh we've really come into our own in the last few years with

the increasing awareness and adoption of AI in the uh uh you know in the real world broadly in enterprise and so on. And uh the re the way we look at our perspective on AI is AI is going to be

the engine of job creation in India for the next uh coming decades. Right? The same way that uh various technological revolutions have disrupted but also created new opportunities. We think we

uh at next spec more broadly we in India have an opportunity to really use AI lean into AI to be a uh transformative force from an economic perspective from an employment creation perspective from

a societal impact perspective and uh it's it's quite contrarian because I think most people typically think of AI as uh and the disruption it brings from the uh damage that it causes but every

disruption also can have positive benefits and that's what we are excited to be part of and I'll speak more about it as we go along but that's uh for a quick introduction.

&gt;&gt; Great. So Riyad I'll turn to you now about uh Udi Foundation and it's uh you know one of the things that's very exciting to see is how datadriven u a lot of the work can be actually we can

learn so much so you've been a very very datadriven organization. So tell me a little bit about what you guys have been doing and especially about what can AI bring to the conversation either in

terms of increasing more women to be in it or understanding women better in it. So tell me a little bit about how datadriven you have been. &gt;&gt; Thank you uh for having me here this

afternoon. It's absolute pleasure to be on this panel with everybody. Um so you're right Audi uh data is the backbone of what we do the decisions we make uh for us it takes precision

perception to precision is what we really believe um and our work is focused on basically bringing more women to the formal economy right so we look at uh women entrepreneurs as job

creators for more women we look at bringing more women into formal employment uh and you know sort of because we feel like that's where um the true value lies and uh as you mentioned

data uh we have a very datadriven approach and I think um you know as far as AI is concerned when you look at gender disagregated data and then you sort of uh divide it by geography by

sector by uh life stage patterns um and you know AI allows you to do that right uh we've basically built out two uh very um important dashboards one is on the private sector. We call that CG. It's

close agenda gap. And we've taken um annual reports of over 2,000 nse listed companies and we've created an index. Uh we've divided that sector-wise. We can measure now um organizations that are

doing well uh in say cross cutting sector sectors like manufacturing or specific um like IT, healthcare um and that helps organizations um act with precision, right? And build

interventions that will actually have measurable outcomes and help move the needle. And I think um you know and on the government side uh with the state government in UB we worked with the

planning department we built something called the Wii index um and again and this is now embedded in the CM's dashboard um in the control room and and it's a small example of impact is I

think in the state of UP they probably had uh about 300 women bus conductors at at you know before this d um this dashboard went live and in a few months they were able to grow that to over

3,000 right Um, so the real insights when you look at when you layer workforce data with infrastructure data, you're looking at housing, transport, safety, child

care, you realize that, you know, women aren't necessarily opting out, but they're it's they're structurally excluded, right? And I think when and and that's what technology that's what

data um helps us identify and and work with stakeholders like state and central government as well as industry and entrepreneurs when we're looking to move the needle with women's workforce

participation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I mean it's great that you're talking about how to bring different women into the conversation first and uh Yash. So I'll uh have you talk a little

bit about you're from the house of Anita Dongray like epitome of fashion and uh you're part of this journey because you see that you know technology etc what it can

bring to further the conversation but your brand has been known for uh engaging with a lot of crafts women from the beginning. So tell us a little bit about what are you doing as a brand to

make sure uh in what ways are you integrating the cracks craftswomen clusters you've created tell us a little bit about that &gt;&gt; hi good afternoon everybody so uh so

ours is a legacy fashion house we're about almost 30 years old today so when I joined the business over a decade ago I was given that very important responsibility of uh you know

integrating technology within the company and it is it has overwhelming because you know when you're a traditional fashion house uh you are used to working with legacy systems

you're used to working with a lot of spreadsheets u I think over the last seven years we've done a great job in digitizing a lot of the business we were the first uh

one of the first companies in India and first fashion house to adopt uh Salesforce across all their verticles which is commerce cloud marketing cloud service cloud so you know we we haven't

ever shied away from making investments in techn technology but I think what I find overwhelming is that we've just sort of it I just feel like it was yesterday that we we went on this

mission and we're already thinking of now it's going to change right &gt;&gt; so it has been overwhelming but I think for us uh coming to your question on on our crafts people I think for us in a

fashion house people are our real assets you know like when when you talk about artificial intelligence you're talking about you know coding you're talking about building systems but for us it's

all it's all about our people and our people is what brings the artistry, the craftsmanship. So, you know, doing good by those people is the most important and and for me uh so we I I would say

work with almost thousand plus uh crafts people across the country both directly and indirectly. So when I say directly, we have actually set up uh skill centers in Maharashtra. We employ about 300

about 300 women where we've trained them in very basic uh skills such as stitching, embroidery and uh and they produce for the brand and then we work indirectly with you know like I said

thousands we work with sea and Gujarat. &gt;&gt; So the way I look at u AI is I look at it as solving very simple real world problems. You know for example these crafts communities don't have the data

to to know what are the uh current trends in that that are working globally they don't have the goto market strategy right they are talented but you know how to take the product to a more global

stage how do they get the relevant product to the global stage so I feel providing them with simple tools just to get those basics which we take for granted because we work in the cities we

have access to you know various applications today that can give you trends you have WGSA and you have all of these amazing applications but they don't have have these applications which

is why a lot of the times the products that are created from the crafts industry are never very relevant &gt;&gt; and which is why they never sell for a very high value. So if we can just get

them that data to you know get up to speed with what's happening in the world I think that itself is a great start you know instead of going into great detail and doing something that is very

advanced &gt;&gt; right yeah and I think it's so true like when uh especially when the pandemic happened we worked with the uh mutin corp to work with all these women that

were uh you know daily wage workers etc just teaching them WhatsApp and how to market on WhatsApp changed their life you know they were like okay I'm making cakes at home and selling it I mean

sometimes doing really small things helps a lot and that actually you know uh the mentorship you're providing leads to talking to Ravi and you've created an amazing platform for actually the most

important thing in all this is building the bridges of creating mentorship so tell us a little bit about what you're doing &gt;&gt; wonderful namaste everybody

um Again it it gives me immense honor to be here. Thank you Lakshmi because you are the ultimate connector. You are all about connecting the the right people at the right time to make magic happen

because it it is at the end of the day the right human connection at the right time makes all the difference. So our company is all about connecting the right people and we have always stood

for this idea called success beyond borders which we have extended to mentoring beyond borders. So it it should not matter where you are in the world whether you are a tier one town

like a Delhi or a tier four city or or a village you should not have any limitations for you to achieve your full potential. So that's been the dream and today we achieved the dream with

technology and AI makes it even more accessible because you know as we were growing up most of us have been told that if you don't speak English you have no chance at success and this is in my

opinion the last remaining challenges of the colonial era because we have been told in fact I'm a family of seven children all all my siblings were in Telugu medium and I was sent to English

because now you will go beyond our borders of small town which I did you know I went to Chennai and then to US and so on but today that barrier is down in fact we have we are working with a

team of AI engineers from Chennai they don't speak English but they said sir why do I need to know English if I know the the technology and AI so I truly feel the last remaining barrier of

language because if you go back to India you know even before the colonials and and the wars happened right language was never the barrier. Whether you were an artisan or uh you making ceramic

products or textiles, it didn't mean what you did mattered. We are at that point again in in for the first time in our evolution and I'm so happy that India is taking full advantage of it and

the tagline keeps uh really in keep me inspired. No other AI summit in the world has a tagline so powerful that involves people. They're talking about chips and technology and data centers

and cooling towers all of those things. India said okay fine all that for what for people welfare for all happiness for all that's what that's achievable right now with technology so we are taking the

aspect of mentorship the human connection as a way to make success happen &gt;&gt; yeah and again continue the conversation of people so Madu tell us a little bit

more about the people that are involved in it and what aspects of AI are we able to build the bridges I mean you've truly Um you know one of the things about people it's not just personally what

happens what's happening in their communities how things are changing so tell us a little bit about with the work that you've seen in what way are the people changing and how the communities

changing &gt;&gt; so let me uh maybe try to answer that with a couple of anecdotes &gt;&gt; right so uh and both of these are like uh experiences that I've had at uh

couple of our next delivery centers So one of our uh centers is in a small town called Chhatur uh and I was there uh a couple of years back actually this when this happened and we we work with a

leading fashion e-commerce uh player. So that also kind of brings in the fashion aspect a little bit into that. So when I uh visited our uh center, we were doing a lot of uh catalog upkeep work and one

of our associates or team leads actually who works on that was very excitedly explaining to me what work she does and describing that there are 74 different types of skirts, which type of skirt is

uh in season, out of season, how she decides that, what are the different attributes, what people search for, what keywords are they searching for and hence what should the description of

that skirt beh like so people can find that skirt and so on and so forth, right? And I was uh completely enthralled, she was extremely passionate about describing all of this to me and

uh when I asked her how how does she know so much about uh skirts and so on, she said, you know, she showed me her phone and said, you know, she follows all the channels on Instagram and

YouTube and so on, right? So uh I think that's that's a example where again building on what you're saying the knowledge that she had of fashion her interest that she had in fashion and

remember this is happening in a place like Chi where if you go outside nobody wears skirts right so she lives in a place where nobody wears skirts she grew up in a place where nobody wears skirts

but she has this interest in uh uh I guess uh dresses and she's picked all of this up and she's able to do that and there are people all over the world who are buying based on the decisions that

she's making right and I think that's that's one example of how uh technology AI and the role of humans in AI kind of plays a role. Another example that I uh like to share is this happened

relatively more recently where uh I visited another one of our centers and I saw two of the two of our uh uh associates uh both uh women again walking uh hand in hand and I just uh

found that curious and I went and asked them hey do you guys like are you guys friends sisters uh what's what's uh you know how do you know each other and as I was engaging with them I got to know

that they essentially are neighbors who live in a village about 20 kilometers away from the town where our center is so they grew up, they went to the same school, they went to the same college,

they come to work together, they go back together, they're just that close friends. And that for someone like me who grew up all over the country getting transferred around, my dad was in a

government job, uh really gave me a perspective into what it would be like if families and communities could actually stay together, have uh lives, entire lives, not just uh uh staying,

but also careers, work and uh everything that goes along with that together. What impact that could have. So I think both of these are examples where in India if we are able to kind of embrace the uh

upcoming AI revolution lean into that and see how that could really start helping us do things. I think the uh avenues are really incredible. what impact that has from individual

opportunities as well as societal and community impact is uh really uh quite significant and I think that's something that's really excited about at next wealth

&gt;&gt; and uh it's really amazing actually working with next wealth and some other people we realize that when you change the life of that one person it's not that their family changes rules of the

game change because their average marriage age is going up and the parents are allowing girls to go to work and be earners etc. Their self-confidence goes up. We I mean we don't have a chance to

show but we have some amazing videos from them where the women are so confident just getting this recognition from us to them gives them so much more excitement and acknowledgement. So u you

know continuing on that yes actually to you &gt;&gt; just to just to add to a point I think uh it's so important for every country realize you know where in the AI

revolution they sit &gt;&gt; I feel in you know US China leading the way in large scale adaptive models computing you know so and they are far ahead in that right so I think for us

instead of trying to play catchup we need to realize that in India our advantage is human capital &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; right we have the skilled engineers we

have the human capital so we can actually make the model for the world on how to democratize AI. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So how do you make AI uh

accessible at a large population level because we are the largest population and and to solve simple problems whether it's healthare whether it's access to education whether it's uh financial

inclusion uh whether it's just like you said getting simple information to them so that their uh work and their business can just you know get that much more amplified. So I think it's is more about

sort of uh you know amplifying intelligence rather than replacing it. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Absolutely. And actually that flows into the work you're doing with ecoware and all these kinds of

stuff. So tell us a little bit about how do we bring data into this? How do we bring some of the practices to uh enhance what he's talking about especially the ecoare and rudi work that

you're doing? &gt;&gt; Uh sure. I think that you know um I think Yash makes a great point. I think we just have to we have to design intentionally right and I think if we

have the awareness I really hope uh we we take advantage of that and that's what we do. I heard a very interesting um tagline where I heard u someone say you know what u AI needs India and um I

I I it gave me something to think about. I think from Ecoare's perspective Lakshmi as a entrepreneur who's built a business uh you know um when you start off capital is limited right you've got

to make very conscious decisions on how you're deploying where you're deploying so from an AI perspective um to build a website to build a brand identity to build you know your marketing costs you

keep thinking at least when we were scaling or founding Ecoare we thought oh you know we need to invest in our people and our machines and you know we'll go build a market like you you kind of

depprioritize these things and I think AI has made some things for starting for starting entrepreneurs a lot easier um you want you can't afford a photo shoot you know you can put an image on

you can say add this give me a Brazil background make it exhaust like whatever it is right so it gives you a few options that way I think um from a sustainability building a sustainable

business and and and practices when you at you know trying to really generate your revenue from a 100% circular economy model it helps certainly helps with uh raw material mapping

manufacturing efficiencies uh mapping your market like I remember when I set up a distribution network for ecoear about back in 2009 I I had distributors across the country and you know they

were large scale stockists but where they sold after that where it went to I I never got a chance to um to leverage that data Right. So I think from um as an

entrepreneur I think this is where AI can certainly help you and it goes back to the point of when you have data you can act with precision you can target the right consumers. you can and you can

spend your capital sensibly, right? It just it it it helps. Um, you know, and I think from uh from Odeti's perspective when we're looking at designing differently, um, you know, we we've got

to design to be inclusive. Um, I think that the conversation I've heard from various sort of pre-AII summits is this democratic diffusion. um you know leveraging infra digital

infrastructure that already exists um leveraging the awareness that we have to be more inclusive you know um and I think skilling plays a very important part I think when you look at women uh

they are over representative in pro possibly like administrative roles etc where AI is going to be the most disruptive but we also know that it's going to create jobs we know that

skilling uh and upskilling plays a very important part you know very recently earlier this year there was an article in newspaper where we where stated we had 950 million users on the internet um

and I think 50% of that were between the ages of 15 and 24 um you know that's really important we leverage that we also you know our the gold guy and CP is using PTM

&gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; that gives me hope right to say that we can there can be this democratic diffusion if we build better uh and we build with awareness and I think uh

yesterday Sanjie Bikchandani who spoke at the opening um summit uh opening session was I think let me I wrote this down because I thought it was actually quite uh this thing so he said if you

don't do AI AI will do you &gt;&gt; so uh do AI basically right and I think it it it summed up the skitting piece very um just really well yeah so and uh you know Ravi talking about you know

continuing on the conversation you um observe a lot of things about uh uh you know gender roles as they're evolving etc. I mean just a little bit about Ravi is that he's a technologist

and does all this but along with his wife he also runs an amazing cultural organization they bring hundreds of dancers and musicians to India and do huge uh uh events where his wife is the

boss and he works for her. So it's great role reversal to see uh but uh um but Ravi tell me a little bit about this gender roles that are evolving and what are you seeing on your platform and even

otherwise. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Thank you. Thank you so much. Uh yes she is the boss and I want all women to be the bosses because I was a speaker at the World Women Economic

Forum and I basically said women please take over the world. Unleash your Anari Shaki because women are naturally inclusive. you know you make sure everybody's happy. Um so absolutely I

think uh it starts at home. So uh you know specific about about the gender question that you mentioned even before AI became a thing uh I was part of a workshop called gender intelligence

because throughout history we talked about gender equality and this woman by one of my very good friends Dr. Barbara Anes wrote five books on gender intelligence where she said there are

certain areas where women are actually better and actually there is data to show women are actually better risktakers because the risk starts with actually giving birth to a child. What

are the bigger risk than that? Imagine a man being told hey you could die but can you have a child? I think every man is going to run away. So this idea of gender intelligence um is now possible

because there is no limitation like I mentioned about the language there's no limitation about gender now with my wife traveling all over the world I'm actually cooking now and I'm using a lot

of tools to really learn so now we can actually remove the gender barrier where both men and women can take care of children handle the handle the uh you know tasks so that the family can move

on so it gives an extremely powerful empowerment tool wherever you are and uh so we work with women empowerment initiatives around the world uh whether it is women who went through some

domestic issues we have an organization in Australia we're working with entrepreneurs in America who are who are colored as they say um so from so many initiatives

this technology you know uh the way I see it you know if you look at the very first internet era it was called a browser that means it has given you a window to the

that brought you products and you got got you connected. AI is a technology that came through that window to empower you directly and you don't have to be in a in a in a city. You don't have to be

speaking English. You don't have to be of a particular gender. You can do accomplish lot more that are really close to your heart like the example he gave about about the skirts that she's

interested in. So lot of opportunity to remove all of these barriers uh the location, gender, language to really empower yourself and India has like uh we talked about we should not catch up

to Silicon Valley because they have immense amount of resources. Let them do that. India has taken a very different approach. Let's lead the world like you said AI AI needs India because at the

end of the day somebody has to use these tools like open I mean Chad GPT raised $500 billion somewhere they have to make money somebody has to use it AI needs India no wonder everybody from the US

has traveled here is because AI needs India and this is our opportunity to make sure that happiness and welfare and uh success happens for all across the bat. Um I just want to say one thing

about the gender thing we talked about. I feel uh it's not about women being more like men or men uh you know men being like women or whatever. I think we each have male and female in us and it's

about giving room for it to come out and I think in the Indian mythology we have a great example of ardanarishwara you know half man half woman and I always say that it's about discovering that in

each of us and allowing that to come out &gt;&gt; and uh and I do want to uh we have uh uh to acknowledge um some people who are here who have done amazing work it's not just uh us who are doing this and we

just happen to be sitting on uh stage and I want to say this because at the end we all hurry and the acknowledgements don't come out so I do want to acknowledge some people before I

ask a couple of questions is one I really want to acknowledge uh you know pa and nha in our team who are here just stand up and they are the ones who had nha is already out doing something else

I think and vib so nha vib prayed now. I want to thank all of you guys because they've had no sleep for the last three weeks putting all these things together especially

prayed now. So number one I want to acknowledge them and secondly I want to thank way back there uh there's Palav who's standing there who uh brings all the things we talk about into ways in

which it's shown out there and I want to acknowledge some audience we have like truly c you know celebrity audience here I really want to acknowledge my friend Deepipa who's here who does phenomenal

work uh she's got the privilege of being Dr. CK Praa's daughter, but really she's bringing amazing things into the world. And I want to acknowledge my friend Arana who's here who just did uh Humans

in the Loop, which was uh one of the most amazing movies uh about this and Kate Key who's here from Chicago. Uh these are all the people who are bringing amazing voices to everyone.

KitK has been at this for the last 30 years. We have known each other. Of course, we were only five when we met. and uh and does an amazing film festival etc. And the reason I'm saying this is

uh that the most powerful people in this room are the audience all of you. So when you finish don't hurry get to know the people ask Ashoke who's sitting there he's our uh big supporter of INC

put your hand up Ashok from even before INC started the first check comes from him every year we do a conference but the point is everything all the work you do here all the people who are sitting

there it's important we work with each other none of this can happen in our own journeys these are just we we could put only five people on the stage. That's why we put five otherwise I would have

put all of you on the stage. So I just want to acknowledge all of you that each one sitting here is as important as anyone else and the more you include us in your thoughts and vice versa. Um it's

great. So I just want to acknowledge the importance as Ravi was saying it's about all of us being together and that's what the message India can give to the world is with sovereign AI with things that

are coming how we each can be part of it and shape it in our own way. Um so with that I want to go back to Yash to you to talk about how um the difference that we can make comes from every small uh piece

of the pie you know so tell us you know we to prepare for this we prepared and then I always like asking a question that we never talked about before so it's one of those moments so if I baffle

him it's okay but uh he's used to this by the way I have to say one of the programs we have is a fellow fellowship program uh and it's going to be called AI Kiran Inc. Fellowship. We're going to

launch it in March and where we pick every year like 10 to 20 amazing people from very very different disciplines and all we do is we put them together and watch the magic happen and Yash is one

of our inc fellows from a few year we we have to always get them before they become famous like if I tried to get him as a fellow now he would have said no I'm too busy but we got him before he

knew he was going to be famous and so that's the only way we get all these good ones uh uh like we should have gotten Arana two years ago. Now he'll be like take a li take a take a you know

stand in the queue. Uh but uh so with that Yash tell me about you work with so many first of all you're a brave man in a very strong women's world and the male fashion is becoming really big these

days. You know men are wearing jewelry I mean all kinds of stuff which is really really cool. So tell me is there a favorite story and while I ask him you can also you al also can think tell me a

quick favorite story or a person or something where you felt wow I can't believe this is what we get to do &gt;&gt; you know so u actually I shouldn't think put him on the spot any of you any of

you I'm I'm giving all of you equal opportunity tell your favorite story of wow this is what I get to do and I must say while he's thinking one of my favorite favorite stories about Yash is

that Anita Dongre in a while she's a huge name now started with two seamstresses on her balcony you know so she had her first workshop in the middle of this slum so after school like any

working mom would take the kids with us so yes as a kid used to go to these slums climb up this ladder and see his mom work on all these things etc and these are the stories that are so

heartwarming and beautiful the reason why the brand stays humble is because they never forgot where uh who all were part of it. So tell us a little bit about someone who played a role.

So I think I mean I'll just keep this more generic to two stories through our journey of the company. Two two come to mind. I think one is what I spoke about earlier is when we set up the skill

development centers in Maharashtra this was a partnership with the government of Maharashtra at the time Mrs. Puna Mahajan facilitated this and uh you know a lot a lot of the land for us uh in

Charoti which is a small tribal village on the Mumbai Ahmedabad highway and we set up our first center I remember we uh opened up the enrollments we had about maybe 100 plus women apply I think about

60 qualify and I remember after the first month we went there for a follow-up visit and I think that's when they got their first paycheck it wasn't much I think maybe each women

must have got about uh 9 or 10,000 rupees But uh it was uh I remember they literally came up to my mother and said like you've come as an angel in our life because these women uh are from tribal

backgrounds so no education they're dependent on their husbands who are basically either wage workers or they work in the city on construction side. Many of them have alcohol problems so

don't spend all that extra money on you know on on on these vices. And uh they said you know for the first time we feel independent because you know this kind this money we are using to you know buy

books for our kids we are sending them and paying our school fees and uh and and what's amazing about the women in Indian villages is that when they have the extra money they are they will spend

it on the household and on their children &gt;&gt; right which is why it's so important to uh empower more and more women in our villages in India. So that's one story I

think which uh really touched our heart. I think the second one for me which is a personal um win was when we launched our store in New York. &gt;&gt; So we were the first uh Indian um

fashion house to open a flagship store uh overseas and and in New York City and uh we opened this beautiful 3,000 foot store in Soho which is a very uh for those of you are familiar with New York

a very uh fashionable and aspirational neighborhood in in New York. And uh I remember uh it was the first few days of the opening and I was living in New York at the time. So I used to be at the

store every day excited to you know meet our customers and there was this one day where this mother daughter was just stand they were intending on coming in but they stood outside the store for a

good four five minutes and they was just looking up at the uh at the signage and uh uh and then they came in and then when they came in you know I could see the mother was a bit teary eyed and then

they just shared they said you know it was so nice to see an Indian uh brand uh standing shoulder to shoulder with all the international greats in in Soho and we just felt so much uh pride and uh and

you know just uh the happiness. So I think yeah these two stories &gt;&gt; personally for me have been very uh uh touching in our journey. &gt;&gt; So Madu has tons of stories but I'm

going to put him on the spot. I want you to tell the story of uh when there's a wedding in the village what happens. This is like one of the coolest stories I

&gt;&gt; think. Uh, no. Thanks. Thanks for that. Lakshmi. Uh, no. I I'll tell two stories today since you said I have tons. &gt;&gt; Unruly. You you you opened the you opened the

box. You can't you can't put it back. &gt;&gt; This is the most fun. You can see AI statistics later. &gt;&gt; We have 18 minutes to go. &gt;&gt; I'll be this is the last.

&gt;&gt; All right. So, uh, no, most serious note, I think the, uh, so I think the the wedding part of it, I think, is a continuation of what I was saying earlier, right? So I think the power of

community staying together and people uh staying in with their families and where they grew up is uh whenever there's a wedding that happens to one of our uh uh employees in one of our centers that

entire team takes off for a whole month and it's a nightmare for us to manage the work right but that's kind of how it works because there for them that uh entire month-long celebration that

happens for a wedding first of all they do celebrate it for a whole month and then everybody's part of all the different uh uh functions that they have the arrangements and so on. And uh it's

more for us to kind of plan our work around that. Uh unlike most of the rest of us who live in big cities and are kind of have come from nuclear backgrounds, we go to a wedding, we

attend half a day, one day at most, right? So that's a completely different uh um experience of people even what it means to kind of work. But I think building on top of that I think one one

other uh anecdotal uh story that I want to share that's been very inspirational of late is uh so I came across uh one of our associates she's a girl she uh actually uh was from Jabalpur in Madhya

Pradesh and uh she uh came out of college during co um couldn't find a job didn't have much to do taught herself uh how to code and uh as uh AI as the AI revolution kind of took off started

applying for a bunch of tasks around what are called code eval tasks uh on various online platforms and got to a stage where she now earns between $40 to $80 per hour. She taught her uh brother

sister how to work on similar kind of platforms. So now you know she and she uh her brother bought himself a motorcycle. her uh sister is kind of paying for her own whole wedding by

herself through her earning from this platform. And uh today she's helping us actually train another uh couple of batches of college students who are still learning software engineering in

different colleges and places we work with to uh learn how to code using AI. Right? So I think you mentioned uh the movie Humans in the Loop which by the way we screened for all our employees.

So thank you for that. But uh here's an example where I want to make a pitch to you for your next movie. I would like you to call it humans in the saddle. Right? So I think uh where you AI really

comes to life is and by itself it's not a scary technology as much as the media hypes it out to be. I think here are real life examples of people that we work with who are really taking charge

using it as a tool and creating uh you know stories for us but lives and impact outside in the real world. Uh that I think is really something that we should be celebrating. So thank you for the

opportunity to squeeze in one more story. &gt;&gt; So we need to do this side that side now to you and then to Ravi. &gt;&gt; Um so I think Lakshmi there again two

stories. So really quickly with uh Ecoare I think um you know started as an experiment two machines 20 people. My husband and I then scaled this up uh to over 100 people and we set up a

manufacturing unit in Greater Anoida back in 2013. I was the only woman at one at the at the starting point and we then had uh we you know built our women team and a lot of these women came in in

the packing department because it's sort of a safe space and like Yash said like you know opening their bank accounts getting that financial independence was just um was great to see and um but what

was even for us more empowering was that they went from sitting and counting and packing to running machines which was really really empowering to see um and to support that hunger to

learn uh you know and I feel again it's it's we need to be inclusive everyone supports this everyone needs to be part of this conversation for growth and when we're talking about inclusion um and I

think from a different perspective from a noi perspective um so I decided you know I wanted to I wanted to step away from ecoay operationally and just kind of do something else and and we debate

returnship a lot. Um and what I loved about Odetti and the vision that Puja who's the CEO has is that um and it and it you know it was all about transferable skills. It wasn't a cookie

cutter model of hiring. Um and it was sort of women creating opportunities for other women which I thought was really like important. Um so yeah those are my kind of two stories.

&gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Ravi, &gt;&gt; can I tell 10? &gt;&gt; I I was like, you know, oh my god, this is too weird. I was just going to tell

him, you can tell 10 stories if you want, but you have 1 minute. So, &gt;&gt; as long as it says 150, you can tell as many stories. &gt;&gt; Got it. No, I think uh you know, by now

you know basically why you wake up every morning to really, you know, have these kinds of stories happen millions of times. You know one of my menty story has become a Bollywood movie which some

of you have seen that drives me every day right and but one story that I want to share very recently we work with you know a program for mentoring MSMES across Bhat and one of them she doesn't

speak English and I was the only one in the company who speaks Tamil so I talked to her in Tamil and she said sir 1000 people there 1000 women she wants to enable employment for them so we

mentored her and and she said and she now feels that in in a year from now she will have a thousand people working for her in organization that's why I told my team that's why we do every what we do

every day connecting them to the right mentors making sure that they feel confident like you said the self-esteem goes up forget about English we don't have to know no English anymore we

talked about it so these this kind of stories is what you know makes me travel around the world you know I was in DHA yesterday Delhi this morning And I mean Mumbai this morning this is for for for

these kind of stories to happen a billion times. That's why AI for all the this conference is very very close to and all of you can make it happen. &gt;&gt; So um as you know we're going to wrap

up. I have 1 minute 23 seconds. I'm standing up again because first of all you have to show the sari. Secondly I'm vertically challenged. If I sit down you can't see me. So what the reasons? So I

just want to wrap up by saying the kind of work that we have all taken on is like a decadel long work. You know sometimes you just kind of say what am I doing? You know there are mornings you

get up and say what's wrong with me you know why am I doing this because some things you work on it takes so long for the needle to move like one inch you know and uh so I do want to say uh you

know there are for me first of all whose company I have and kitari she's not here right now because she's uh judging something else she's the one I started this with and I also want to acknowledge

my friend Archa who's here when we started this she's the one who stepped up and really led Inc women and AI kiran to where it is. I really want to thank you guys and I just want to end on we're

talking about we were talking about stories on this story of uh you know to me whatever we do it has to help someone if we can make a change to one person for one minute in their life it's good

enough. So I do have to say Sun Krishnan is someone who rescues women out of prostitution. We've been working with her. One story she told on the stage was so powerful. We were able to raise

millions of dollars for her and within one year she built a home she dreamt for the women she's rescuing. So uh and I met an 80-year-old girl who you know who had her last breath in that home happy.

So to me every time we wonder what the heck are we doing. I think of that girl and say if all the work we have done has made someone happy for a day in that miserable life she had if she had her

end days to be happy and we get to work with really cool people like our fellows like Yash and uh I do have to say at the end my friend Anand Gandhi has sent someone here and I'm so excited because

Anand is one of the most brilliant people I have ever met in my life. He's bringing out something called the world of Maya. I want you all to be watching out for it. It's going to change the way

India will be seen across the globe and I'm very excited to be able to work with all of you with people like all of you. And so every time I wonder what the heck I'm doing, I just call one of them and

uh like for example, Yash throws some of the best parties. I don't have to do anything. Show up with 50 of my friends. I call him and say 30 of us are coming. Then I call him and say no 40 of us are

coming. Then I call him and say, "No, there's going to be 50." So I want to thank all of you for giving up the most precious thing you have, your time. And please go to aikiran.ai and become a

member. It doesn't cost you anything. 5 minutes of your fingers time. Aikiran.ai. titled data governance at the intersection of digital public

infrastructure and artificial intelligence. And here we aim to explore how data governance practices in digital public infrastructure affect and enable AI development in the global majority

world. And we aim to build a dialogue bridging government, civil society, research and technical communities on developing governance frameworks that align with the BRICS declaration's

emphasis on sovereignity, equity, and participation. Um we have a great lineup of speakers with us um this afternoon. Um I will start here with Chinasa. Chanasa Colo is the founder of

Technicultura, a policy specialist at the United Nations Office for Digital and Emerging Technologies and a recent computer science PhD graduate from Cornell University. Her research focuses

on AI governance and safety for the global majority world, dataification and algorithm algorithmic marginalization and the geopolitical impacts of AI. Then we have Smitty Par

and independent researcher studying the interactions between digital technologies and society. She is also a PhD candidate at the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi. Then we have

Venicius Defaria Silva who is a digital technologies advisor at Brazil's Ministry of Management and Innovation and Public Services with over 24 years of experience in digital technologies,

innovation ecosystems and adaptive governance of large scale digital infrastructures. Then we have Marian Diaz Hernandez who is a Venezuelan human rights activist, researcher and writer.

Her work spans online freedom of speech, privacy, internet infrastructure, web filtering and digital security. Her most recent research delves into the intersection of identity and the body as

shaped by technology. The session will be moderated by Pratik Wagre, head of programs and partnerships, Tech Global Institute. I request Pratik to take the discussion forward. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Just doing a check if you can hear me. Okay. Uh thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon in the quieter confines of the Sush Masarat Bhan compared to Bharat Mapam. uh and you

know for this for this important conversation on uh you know these two governance topics that that we've seen coming together in the last couple of years around digital public

infrastructure and and artificial intelligence right and uh and specifically I think what we wanted to explore today was the data governance aspect of it because as we're seeing

interest uh and movement uh towards using you know uh various forms of digital public infrastructure in terms of identity programs, you know, payment rails, all of these feeding into uh, you

know, artificial intelligence and how that's also then being used for service delivery uh, for citizens. I think it's important to sort of address the question of, you know, how is the the

data that's forming the basis of some of this coming together, what are the safeguards that we have uh, and you know, how that process is is unfolding, how those conversations are happening

and you know, and how that how that sort of goes ahead. Uh so with that you know uh I think just in terms of housekeeping the way we'll do it is I'll ask you each a question to start with uh and you know

about three or four minutes each and then based on what you say and also certain threads that I want to pull on I'll you know maybe do another round of questions and then we can open up to uh

to to the audience for Q&amp;A. So Vinc, I want to start with start with you first. Uh right and maybe I guess ask you to uh just reflect on you know what the the Brazilian government's journey has been

with roll out of some of the you know some DPI programs and specifically I guess in in the data governance uh context. What sort of challenges have you seen? What sort of breakthroughs uh

have you know have you sort of been witnessed to in this journey? &gt;&gt; Yes. Uh good afternoon everyone. Uh yeah, we have been going through uh uh strong movement in terms of uh first uh

at first uh whole government platforms that gradually some of them has uh grew up to become uh more like DPI with societal impact you know and uh uh being very honest with you what I what I can

say is that uh in terms of data governance I mean uh the same problems that we used to have we have now. I mean it's a uh I mean we didn't fix this these things to to to do DPI and and uh

actually uh somehow GPI make easy to create new new data source big data source centralized ones that is good somehow but it's also I mean creates some some issues and uh so I could say

that uh in terms of the relationship between GPI and data governance I they are they they have their own tracks you know I mean it's a the data governance uh uh track is much more related to the

I mean what you do after afterwards you know afterwards the transactions and so on and uh and of course GPI has I mean has been creating a lot of valuable data and uh and uh and we have AI and kind of

coming up strongly and then yes then we have a lot of challenge in terms of I and and actually the old challenge they are still there but but we we need to shortcut to some new ones for example

regarding how to train uh AI models, how to do that respecting privacy and uh and so on. &gt;&gt; I got it. And if if I can just maybe follow up on that since you know we

still have a couple of minutes left on on on that. uh so you said you know data governance and uh DPI essentially in two different two different tracks right so how do you then sort of see them coming

together uh because that's where there's a lot of at least conversation on right so what's been your experience on on &gt;&gt; wonderful this is pretty much what I guess the biggest challenge that we are

going through I would say that one of one of the pillars of this uh approach that we are trying to do is the I mean the verifiable credentials wallet you know and uh and this is how we think

that uh we are going to exchange data uh more smoothly inside government and uh also from uh government institutions and with the private sector you know having the citizen kind of controlling the

process I mean with his own wallet you know so uh uh this is something that we are kind of investing a lot and we believe that this model is uh promising It's a from one side I mean the the

personal information side I mean uh from the transaction uh data set side which are big big data sets and so on uh I mean we have been going through since the since since I mean many years ago

trying to do big data leaks and so on that didn't work and and uh of course they work for something but they they didn't do that magic that we thought that oh big a big

data lake that will solve everything. It's not that way. Actually, we will have uh uh local databases forever in hospitals in uh some specific agencies and I mean it's not it's not going to

change. I mean just put everything in one place and uh then then we are coming up with a lot of kind of trying to to come up with solutions for uh how to gather this data to train AI models you

know for example hospital data for example how to use this data for training AI models uh without kind of compromising the privacy of the people of the citizens and and uh and so we

have been going through for example we have been talking to India about deeper training that is a technology that differential uh uh uh uh privacy. Uh we have been going through other

technologies also like federated learning and uh so this is this is something very kind of strategic I guess at this moment you know. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you for that. Chinas I

want to come to you next uh right and and I guess from from your from your vantage point at at at you know at Odette and general work how are you sort of approaching this question of u I

guess making DPI data available responsibly uh you know for for training some of these models uh and I guess from from your perspective what you also see in

terms of the infrastructure that's required uh and some of those you know those challenges that are needed or that that you see to support this this process.

&gt;&gt; Most definitely. So I would say that having sufficient data infrastructure is actually what's most important when it comes to DPI. Um a lot of governments have a lot of you know this data mostly

within paper records or let's say like offline records and also in structures or formats that are not easily um available to implement or leverage for training AI models or let's say even

just basic algorithms. Since I think that's um two or so things that governments have to really focus on. Um in my office at the United Nations, I don't focus I don't work on DPI. We

mostly do the AI policy and um international coordination stuff. Um but my uh colleagues are really working on just trying to understand what governments need from DPI. Um and then

also basically how they can you know develop relationships with partners um whether they be in the respective countries um that they are in or external to understand what are the

needs for these respective systems um and then also how can we ensure value alignment when it comes to understanding uh what DPI is needed for the countries and then also how do we come to

agreement on the actual technical and social infrastructures um of DPI more broadly as well. Right. Uh uh thanks for that and uh man I want to come to you next right uh and maybe

from I guess uh from you know from from your perspective in terms of uh when you look at this across the whole life cycle uh right and u in this this process of you know this

this intersection that we're thinking of and and data governance I guess from the uh what have you seen seen uh and you know and maybe you have case studies to reference in terms of you know what

you've seen in maybe uh in in South America in especially when it comes to around I think some of the other questions around uh representation uh you know community design and and you

know and and robustness of of DPI solution so you know what has your experience been uh when you're looking at this from from that from that perspective

Thank you. Um, so the BI in my experience is often discussed as if it is a technical product that you deploy and then move on like it's it's done already and in

practice it is a a social process a political process that is continuous. So we think about the BI in five stages. conception and scoping, strategy and design, development, deployment, and

operations and maintenance. And uh both deployment and operations and maintenance are not phases that loop back to close a circle. It you might imagine it as a spiral, right? It just

goes on. You always have to be maintaining the that system. Um because the risks that are related to exclusion to surveillance to abuse um do not appear at any one single moment.

They continue to appear emerge as the system evolves as society itself evolves and uh when governance and accountability be become weak then the harm becomes

structural. So the thing with this and what we are seeing at least in in the countries that I have worked in in Latin America and and across the world is that we do all of the conception, scoping,

strategy, design all the way to operations and then we tack on um some sort of remedy, safeguards, whatever you want to call it um to the risk that are going to start emerging.

When you do that, you are leaving aside a set of possible potential risks that are specific to that society that you should have been seeing from conception. So you you should have

included um the communities in the design of the systems from the beginning. And so what we see and I'm going to just touch on my first example right now which is Mexico.

Um recently Mexico did an overhaul of their identity system which touches on a myriad of things. It is in practice it's a DPI system even though they are not calling it that like that. and the data

flow. Um the reform facilitates international data transfers and government access without effective controls including uh geoloccation data um biometric data. It circulates across

borders. It's shared uh from public to private and back. It it's just it's a mess. Um, and so these risks are very concrete because we're talking about a reform that is aimed to help with

disappearances of people, people who who who are disapparidos who are taken away and uh in practice does the exact opposite just exacerbates those harms. And u there are ways of doing that

way but I'm going to leave it for later. No thanks that that that was helpful. Uh and I want to come to you next. uh I guess you know um as as the resident Indian on the panel and

you know and and DPI conversation is something that that's that's been that's been pushed but you know and uh I just maybe you know from you wanted to get a sense uh you know based on the Indian

experience what are I guess the larger uh lessons we can draw around uh questions of you know uh inclusion equity and resilience of some of these some of these processes and systems that

that be rolled out. &gt;&gt; Thank you and thanks so much for having me in this conversation. You know, we've obviously been hearing a lot about the DPI AI integration and I guess the way

to look at it is, you know, what would this integration entail, right? And what are the data governance and equity implications at each of these levels and I would say there are three kinds of

integration that are possible, right? One is about creating global resources. You know there's conversation about compute systems and data sets at an international collaboration level and

that's more about pushing backs on the dominance on some of the global north entities and how can the global south make coalitions right and yesterday there was a very interesting article by

an Indian journalist Adity Agarval which says that there is possibly a likely outcome out of this summit which could lead us in that direction that's one kind of question and the data governance

there the questions are you know what would be the crossber flow mechanisms we know that's an unsettled issue between a lot of countries So how will that be you know resolved? Where would all this data

reside? What will happen in a geopolitical crisis between these partners? So that's one set of questions right. The second question is around uh AI as an input into DPI. So in the

Indian contest we've heard announcements about uh for instance AI being incorporated in the Aadhaar ecosystem which is our digital identity project for the purposes of fraud detection for

the purposes of using language models to make the ecosystem more accessible to a larger number of people. So you know we are hearing those examples but we've also seen examples from India but as

well as from other jurisdictions like the infamous incident in Netherlands where you know they used uh AI in their public welfare system and found that there is a lot of mclassification

happening misargeted. People were being wrongly accused of committing fraud and they were excluded from the system. We usually think these are global south incidents and problems but it is quite

pervasive whenever you try to you know deploy AI without thinking through these consequences. And the last which I I worry the most about I think is the reverse problem of you know uh trying to

fit DPI into AI. Right. So DPI as a feeder into the AI ecosystem. And recently we have the uh you know a set of AI guidelines that have come out from the Indian government. And one of the

use cases they talk about there is the the day ecosystem right which is the data empowerment and protection architecture India which is the consent management system that is being adopted

in various sectors also has been kind of blessed by our new data protection act. So the idea there being that it's a consent management system where electronically an individual can give

their consent and say you know I agree for my data to be shared by X company to Y company for a certain you know purpose and I can define the parameters around that and the suggestion seems to be how

can this become a feeder into training data sets for AI and I think there is where we need to worry from a data governance data protection perspective because consent as a mechanism which is

the basis of this whole ecosystem is so broken we know that that's well recognized. You know, there are structural power problems, there's consent fatigue, all of that is not

going away. You have a verifiable form of taking consent, but that doesn't mean from an individual's perspective, you know, it's all sorted. And then when you take that data, you're talking about

personal data, you make that an input into AI, then that's really something which needs to be debated and thought through very very carefully, you know, before we go down that path.

&gt;&gt; Thanks. And you know incidentally I was doing my second question uh to you but uh I'm I'm so it in fact the good segue into the the other part which you know uh which I wanted to bring about was um

you know to for this integration and you know considering the challenges that that you that you highlighted there is going to be this element of data sharing between different types of entities

right uh whether it's the public sector and the private sector or within different parts of the government's uh you know within different branches of the government or different you know

regional national uh and and those sort of conversations uh you know that that that come in right so I guess from from from that and V's this question is al also to you in terms of you know what

have you seen uh in terms of those models and what you know what should we be thinking about uh because this conversation is sort of is is happening is and there's a certain certain

trajectory certain pace to it uh to it already. So what should we be thinking of? What should we be looking out for? You know, both in terms of I guess the data sharing models, even sometimes the

governance models in terms of how sometimes some of these systems may be set up uh either as you know whether they should be uh completely public entities or whether there is a public

private partnership uh and those sort of things. So I guess that's question for both of you. Maybe Vinc and then and then and then &gt;&gt; yes uh we we have we have go went

through uh this journey of data sharing uh with a kind of uh uh data buzz that kind of abstract and gives you access to a lot of database inside govern uh yes we made a good progress I could

say since the last 10 15 years But what we have been realizing is that uh if you want to kind of share this data I mean actually most of this data are belong to the citizens and if you want

to share this data I mean for the citizen in the name of the citizen uh it's very hard you do that I mean uh kind of uh letting the the citizen I mean kind of

just watch that and also ize approve you know I mean actually what we have been learning is that the sharing process with the private sector should be triggered by the citizen you know not by

the uh not by the government itself you know it's not like the government talk to a company and say oh nice let's let's share the data of the citizens you know

and then we ask the citizens if if they want it's a it's a sometimes there have initiatives which are have goodwill that has been made in this way but they are very kind of uh fragile in terms of

private preserving and also and also legally very very fragile also and in terms of uh sustainability technical and institutional sustainability because these are kind of arrangements that are

done which are not quite well set up you know and uh and they are very fragile. For example, when you cross new governments and so on and uh and uh this is as I told you why we are putting a

lot of efforts on verifiable credentials that we think that actually most of this data is private data, personal information data uh that the citizen kind of want to use for his I mean

better doing the things in the life you know uh uh I mean documents from the government uh uh other kinds of do of documents and uh to make I mean to to to make business to do a lot of things in

the in the the real economy the the digital economy also and uh this is what we think that I mean uh might kind of solve this and just to wrap up what we have been learning also is that to

manage consent uh this way I mean uh with this perspective of I mean like the government gathering all the data and sharing with the the the the for example private companies and and kind of try to

make the citizen decide it's too complicated to kind of control this kind of consentment you know it's too granular it's too I mean uh uh it demands a lot from the citizen and and

uh it has not been uh kind of has not showed to be kind of actually productive you know and uh and this is why we are kind of putting all all of our bets on the the wallets and the VC wallets

Got it. Thanks. You want to take that? &gt;&gt; So I think there are you know so many layers as you pointed in the question itself right whether we're talking about personal data or non-personal data which

kind of entities which kind of arrangements and each kind of layer can have its own problems and concerns and things to be wary of. uh you know if you just take health data as an example we

know health digitization is a big move happening in a lot of countries including ours to ask there is you know what are the kind of incentives being created when we

tell everyone take your analog or physical uh you know medical checkup or medical reports and convert them into a digital format there are questions there about you know then who gets access to

that data what is my agency in that relationship when I go to a doctor usually you know I'm not in a power to say uh you know don't do this or do this with my data at that point you just want

redress to your um ailment and you you you will agree to most things. So there is a inherent power imbalance in that situation. So what consent given in that context how can that be translated into

other context you know will that data be available to insurance companies to pharma companies to researchers. So there are questions to be unpacked and then what are the governance layers and

mechanisms around each of that and as you rightly said you know in the Indian context there is a political economy in which these ecosystems have evolved what we call the technolleal approach has

evolved in a particular manner. it is about uh you know based on the premise of a public private partnership uh in which most of these systems have been developed but there is also the

questions of incentives behind all of that right so when we say AI will also be used for things like you know technal solutions for transparency accountability I guess the question is

whether those same incentives will translate you know it's possible use case but are there enough people who see a business use case who will see an ecosystem develop like will we see those

kind of use cases being adopted or will it be more in context where commercialization of data is the logical outcome. So I guess those are the kind of open questions.

Uh thanks. So uh Chinasan Marin I saw both of you nodding at various points in to that question. So I just wanted to give you also the opportunity if there's something you know along this if you

wanted to add along this question of you know data sharing between different entities whether they're you know public sector private sector or within the public sector and and you know and some

of the questions that both Venicious and Smithy raised if you know if you have thoughts about that because I saw both of you nodding very vigorously at different points. So uh

&gt;&gt; yeah I'm just a big nodder so I will probably be doing that a lot but more broadly when it comes to the governance aspects uh my work focuses on Africa and my personal capacity as a researcher and

so there are actually lots of provisions within national data privacy strategies or um laws and then also even regional um efforts from organizations like Echoas which is for West Africa, SADC,

South Africa and EAC which have their own data privacy uh laws as well and so it provides a lot of opportunities for crossber data sharing but I think the systems are not necessarily in place um

to actually facilitate that kind of data transfer and so um as we put these laws into practice particularly within Africa I think some of this also applies to the Indian context um that we also ensure

that infrastructure can is also in compliance you know with these respective laws &gt;&gt; so many bottoms Um

yeah, a couple of things. Um first on consent because there was a lot of of of talk on consent and um deeply agree with in in terms of the importance of of consent and meaningful consent where

there is an imbalance in power. And um Venicu says something along the lines of concept being too granular for to to to be practical with which I violently disagree. Um because I think that in the

granularity is where the solution lies. Um we live in a global society where anonymity is disappearing and that is seen as something good. I have gone to I don't know how many conventional

conferences forums where the makers of identity solutions say outright that uh this is going to eliminate anonymity finally. Yay. And I want to cry and scream and kick something I and often

do. Um but anonymity not only is uh necessary for democracy and for free speech and for all human rights but it is also a spectrum and we are seeing it as a

binary as yeah there are fully anonymous and men with a mask we don't know who they are they are a criminal if you needed why do you need to hide something and um the reality is that for many of

the transaction ctions that the systems that we are building require identity full identity the transaction actually doesn't need that the transaction needs some piece of

information I I say when you go buy alcohol the system whatever system it is needs to know if you are of age the piece of information is not your birth date is

not your age it's not your name it's yes or No, are you of age? And that is all. So that transaction can be made pretty much anonymous. Then in some places you might need to share more and more

information until you get to the doctor and they know everything about you and that is scary. But um for there to be meaningful consent, you have to have control over which different scenarios

are you uh sharing different information in. And the person has to understand that. And if we keep building um these systems that basically want to babysit adult people um then people are

never going to be able to actually have agency over their rights. &gt;&gt; No, thank you. And and I think uh great points there and maybe and just to I guess build uh from that and also maybe

segue into the next point that I wanted to raise and you know going on the point of agency and rights uh because we're also seeing I think this concept or this idea that these will be you know

designed to make decisions about uh about people right and I think at various points some of you have already touched on that. Uh so that brings in this question of you know uh

of discrimination and algorithmic fairness and how that lays into uh this conversation and and and I guess maybe and this is for all of you to to maybe come in on uh was where do you see the

this you know this question the larger question framing that we have today of this you know the data governance and and this intersection and how does that tie in with uh what could happen with uh

you know especially this this um thing of when it's deployed and it's being used to make decisions about people uh and there is risk for exclusion what should we be taking into

taking into account what should we be watching out for uh in that process and if there are maybe uh examples that you've come across in in in in all of your work as well I think that would be

useful for for everyone to hear uh so maybe we can start with you as you wish. Um yeah, I think that technology is a magnifying glass. Technology doesn't

create discrimination. There is discrimination in society and technology amplifies it and I mean all technology AI particularly like more powerful technology will do so more powerfully

like that just basic right and uh there are a few things in there. Um, of course, why is there discrimination in society? Because of invisibilization. There are sectors in each society and

it's different in each society. Uh, sectors of the population that have been invisibilized for longer than that have not been able to participate in decision making. They have not been able to

participate in the design of the systems that rule them. So, how do we start fixing that? It's just a start. We start by listening to the people to everyone in the design of the systems. The the

example that I mentioned earlier and it's a positive example. I live in Chile. I am from Venezuela. I have I had to run from Venezuela. I live in Chile and um Chile uh it's not a perfect

country by any means. There's a lot of discrimination, but they have some systems that work and they recently uh changed their data protection law. our that the prodal law.

Yeah. Um and it's it's coming into uh effect this year and the process by which the law was created had a lot of consultation consultation with NOS's consultations with with just a society

NOS of digital rights of which Chile has some of the best um consultations with migrant organizations. I as a migrant I I am also engaged in that and it is a very decent law. It is a law that for

crossber data flows has a lot of examples to look to in terms of safeguards in terms of how to build um a data protection authority that actually should work at least in paper so far.

And uh that is because they already had a law that was some sort of okay and then to iterate on that again they listened to like they had a lot of consultation processes. So you can get

there. Um if you do the opposite you get Venezuela which is just a a mass of of laws that were completely unconsulted. But um and that massifies the problem right. So it should be through

consultation not only with the experts and with the companies but also with just the people because again what we are doing is infantilizing the population like thinking that someone

because they are poor they don't have university degrees they don't have anything to say about how their data is handled and that is not true. Like not only is it stupid to say it's also just

simply not true. Yes. Uh just just uh I mean uh uh enforcing we we want to put wallets on the hands of each citizen you know so that they can share their data by

attribute with selective disclosure. I mean this is I mean this is what we are uh looking for but at the same time we have all these uh big data sets problem that it's a

kind of let's say uh transactional data that is related to citizens but they are not kind of a private information themselves you know uh or or personal information sorry PII information and uh

and uh this is where we are kind trying to kind of find solutions but we don't have a an answer for that you know it's actually we are just trying to see how this new technology you know like

privacy preserving technologies uh all these uh federated uh uh machine learning how these things could kind of uh fit or not you know uh uh a kind of new data governance model you know which

could deal with all these uh complexities you know and uh and uh but Yeah, it's a kind of a big challenge. It's not easy, you know. &gt;&gt; Yeah, just to, you know, add to what my

fellow speakers were saying, I think the problem of discrimination is a very real and unsolved problem in most societies and it the way it interacts with the AI conversation I think is at two levels.

On one level, it could uh you know uh reduce the overt kind of prejudice-based discrimination that happens in human interactions and that's a positive that can come out of it. But on the other

hand, it can really amplify the statistical discrimination that happens when you take group based characteristics and try to make you know presumptions about individuals based on

that right and you just to take examples from the Indian context we know that there is a you know a cast hierarchy to credit access. So you know you take that data set you know that uh you know under

trial prisoners are far more in numbers in terms of minority groups. You take that as a data set you know women of childbearing age are likely to re leave you know the job market sooner than

others. So all of these factors are true in themselves. But when you make like you know presumptions and models which take this training data set then you really have the chances of amplifying

that even with no human interventions and that then combines with coming back to the data governance question you know this generalized assumptions with very individualized personal data. For

instance, in the credit case, talking about taking alternate forms of data, right? Taking your uh mobile phone history as a data point to determine whether to your creditworthy, taking

your SMS records, your social media profile. So, the interaction between these two kinds of generalized information and very personal information can have a kind of

disastrous effects which is something we really need to investigate. We know we talk about there are you know pockets of information about what can go wrong but I don't think we have systematically

investigated this mostly because you know this is obscure systems which we don't really have insights into and u researchers are not able to you know unpack this because we don't have that

transparency. Yeah, really great responses from my co-panelists and I would say that when it comes to bias more specifically a lot of the academic literature um on this is

really focused let's say more so on racial bias which comes from constructs you know that have been rooted in the United States and also in Europe you know while racial bias does happen in

Latin America for example and also um in Africa it's a little bit less because you know there are only a couple countries particularly those within southern Africa like Batswana uh Namibia

and South Africa that actually do have let's say more populations of white people versus other African countries, but for the most part they are quote unquote like racially homogeneous. And

so if you try to apply those measurements or or uh constructs into measuring and evaluating bias, then it really doesn't provide you with sufficient information to understand

where your models are failing. And so when it comes to non-western context more broadly um integrating measurements that focus on cast, religion, tribe um and also gender and also the

intersection of all of these is actually a bit more important for governments and also organizations working in these regions um to measure um and then also evaluate

&gt;&gt; and thanks for that. I think uh all very interesting uh responses. I I want to slightly switch gears and I'm also looking at this ominous looking timer in front of me. Uh so you know so this is

just to flag you know just of m that I I'll come to the audience for questions. So if you have something just you know just keep your questions ready just maybe go one one last round uh for the

panel here. uh I guess you know one another part of this conversation that that that comes up uh is uh you know in this context is maybe you know regal frameworks and how you share data across

borders. This is a conversation that's come up in in uh in this context as well. uh and you know and I think that brings up various questions of uh one in terms of you know what you know in in

some cases commitments that countries have made at at you know at at various international uh forums in terms of sharing data across but also you know given the current geopolitical reality

you know I think a lot of countries are also thinking or rethinking uh you know these these data sharing um arrangements or at least how open they want to be uh right and and and and I think I I know

you know in in I think in the African context, South American context there is some there are some regional frameworks uh that uh you know that various countries have explored. So if you know

if you could hear from you on on on some of them uh and you know how how and what you've seen basically in in those in in that context and and you know maybe to go out uh and and what you think might

change this this this is a tough one. I'm putting you on the spot. You can only uh only choose to answer it if if if you want to. You don't have to answer it. But you know, just in terms of

shifting geopolitical realities, how you think some of these might actually might actually change if they if they'll actually hold up. So we could maybe go in the reverse

order. &gt;&gt; Yeah, happy to start. And so when you were talking about the question at first, two words came up. Uh localization and also sovereignty, which

is I'm sure that's been a very popular word throughout the conference or summit. Um and so governments are understanding that basically in alignment with some of their existing

data privacy laws that localization of data um is a requirement and that they don't have the infrastructure in place um to align with these laws respectively. Um and then also even just

from a technical standpoint, it's much easier to access data if it's housed in servers um in the country or even you know closer to where you're actually working or implementing um these

respective solutions. Um and then sovereignty more broadly, you know, plays into this localization providing a little bit less reliance on these um you know, big tech companies or foreign

providers. Um well, you know, a lot of them will still have play a role um in local ecosystems or tech ecosystems. Um I think that these two localization and sovereignty really go hand in hand.

&gt;&gt; Just to add to that, yeah, I think you know at the geopolitical level, this is a conversation going on for a few years. There have been many countries pushing very hard for what is called the free

flow of datas, right? And they are usually countries which are also where uh the biggest companies are located or originate from and they are historically the ones who've gained advantage from

the concept of free flow of datas and they're the ones who are pushing at it or the international stage. The the G20 has been a forum where a lot of this discussion has happened. A few

developing countries including India have maintained the position that you know there are inequities in that concept of free flow of data and we want to have uh opportunities for what is

being called data for development right which means uh the sovereignity question right you know how is data being utilized locally can we restrict it for certain use cases etc and and that's a

tension which is still brewing and in in that there is of course the added layer of data localization right which is uh we've seen that in our data protection law finally adopted a fairly liberal

position compared to the uh other countries with data protection laws saying we're going to allow free flow of data but reserving space for sector specific restrictions and really that is

where you know I think the future will lie because it on the face of it it looks like we have a very liberal regime on data flows but it doesn't change the fact that on you know payments data on

telecommunications data many kinds of data we already have localization restrictions so I I think that balance is still not Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. Uh uh I guess that this is this is

as as we have been saying an area that is very kind of open and uh and uh there is no I I guess uh perfect solution yet and uh and uh we we see two ways. I mean it's pretty much what I have been

saying. One thing is to get the data to the citizen in their wallets you know and then they are the they have the authority to do what they want. If uh for example a Brazilian has got uh some

I mean the documents as VCs in its wallet in his wallet and uh a bank in Argentina for example is able to verify that verifiable credentials maybe because the government has made a kind

of interoperability agreement and so on. I mean it's up to the citizen I mean although there are some legal issue and so on. I mean it's a and and coming back to that big problem that is the big data

sets which are kind of a mixture of uh transactional which are partially I mean private partially kind of how the business uh runs uh uh this this is more complicated. We have been taking a look

at for example the data roaming concept that is a kind of a way to and to move securely your data in a kind of controlled network when they have controlled nodes like a data embassies

you know and uh which is looks interesting uh it's a technology uh European technology very strongly based on studentization but I mean it's kind of a

state-of-the-art you know I mean it's a uh we need to I I mean to see I mean what the what this means in terms of technically architecturally and also socially how this kind of a because

we're talking about trust so I mean we need to to to see how these things develop make some experimentations the small experimentations controlled ones so that we can try to to to to scratch

that. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I think that this is also an issue of um power imbalance um because to go back to my initial

example um who is the data flowing to from Mexico it's the United States there might be uh agreements there might be treaties but it's that factically it's about the power that the US has over the

over Mexico so it's not an equal relationship ship there when the data flows and uh then we have to ask like as we say like always follow the money right who is the data benefiting like

who is this data for in the case of the states it is for policing it is for immigrations or for cracking down on on on migrants legal and illegal and everyone and it's it's not for the

citizens it is just like police state So in the case of Chile for instance when the data flows it flows mostly to Argentina and to Brazil as well but but mostly to Argentina. Who does the data

benefit? Big companies because it is about targeting, advertisement and just marketings. And uh so when we create laws and policies and public policies and and and just strategies in general

that are about how do we allow the data to flow? And we think about all the things that we mentioned, right? Anonymization when when possible, minimization when possible, selective

disclosure when possible, all of that we have to ask also the question of who is the data benefiting is supposed to ex to operate in order to benefit the citizen. No, in order not in order to benefit uh

faceless uh actors. Thank you. I think lots to lots to think about. Uh going to open it up for to the audience for questions if there are any. &gt;&gt; Yes, I see.

&gt;&gt; Sure. Sure. Ju just very very fast a lot of things that we have been coming up the last uh 30 minutes I guess. uh they are about kind of uh how to manage ecosystems GPI

ecosystems you know what incentives you give for as as she has been saying who who who earns something with that data who can take advantage for some reason uh to make easy some transaction I mean

I guess at the end of the day what we're talking here is how how a DPI kind of may uh uh control the flow of data or kind of uh influence that you and uh and it's about as as she said incentives uh

rules and everything else. &gt;&gt; Thanks for that. Uh I think there was &gt;&gt; Charles question. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we're short on time. So maybe we'll just take one question and

then I'll leave it to the panel to respond. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Perfect. Well, I first I just want to uh say to Marian, I think we are kindred spirits in our suspicion

of the state and our respect for anonymity. So more power to you. Um Smithy, thank you so much for bringing up the conversation around uh consent. Obviously, it's a massive issue. Um I'm

kind of grateful that you did because uh you're right, we we are building AI layers on top of DPI. Um the question which I've written down was um I'm a forensic investigator. Um so my concern

is chain of custody and uh if an AI model accesses financial data for example via a consent manager and then leaks it who becomes the data fiduciary under the DPTP for example is it the AI

app the bank the consent manager and u right now it kind of feels like we're building a chain of deniability as opposed to custody uh where every layer kind of blames the other uh from a

liability perspective is there a clear audit trail uh mandate for DPI guys or are we effectively creating state sponsored black boxes? A very interesting question. I don't

know who wants to take that. &gt;&gt; So I think your answer is in the question you know as you said very correctly. So there are layers of entities and there is a bit of you know

behind the wheel what is happening the lack of who is the processor who is the controller who is you know going to be eventually responsible. I think the way consent management is designed currently

it is only about the first layer of you know whether consent was taken and is there an auditable trail about that not about the whole chain of what has happened to the data did it exceed that

mandate of consent and what happened where did it land up and I think ideally if we want to push with the technal approach that's where we need to be thinking about you know from the

citizens perspective how do you take that whole trail and make it really someone accountable when that falls uh but That's not I think where the conversation is right now.

&gt;&gt; All right. Okay. Uh so thank you. I think with that uh we'll we'll wrap up this conversation. I hope you know and you know thank you to all of you for for sharing your insights uh given giving us

a lot to think about uh and I hope you know the folks who joined us you you've had uh you know useful time listening to this and hopefully go away with a lot of questions as as we try to answer some of

the broader questions. So thank you. and the transformative role of AI, machine learning and computer vision in enabling smart logistics and consumer welfare.

So this is going to cover the two critical areas that's public distribution system and consumer welf welfare. Before getting in I would like to invite esteemed panelist onto the

stage and take the seats. I would like to invite Miss Nur aay Shivas IAS director civil supplies government of Andhra Pradesh.

Ma'am I'd like to invite uh Mr. Hardik Dawe, founder and CEO Road Vision AI private limited Mr. Adita Wardan founder Vexolabs

Mr. Parasai Suratu, CTO, RNIT AI solutions, Mr. Lakshmi Wanker, co-founder and CTO, Real Variable Digital Asset Services Private Limited,

Miss Nomi Hashimoto, Deputy Country Director, United Nations World Food Program. Miss Theresa Matthew, South Asia lead disruptive technologies and venture

capital with IFC. Thank you. Thank you very much uh esteemed panelist uh for coming here and uh taking your respective positions. So um I would like to set the context uh

for today's discussion. Maybe I'll take five minutes before getting into the engaging discussion with the esteemed panelists and we'll move forward from So when we talk about public

distribution, public distribution is not just another kind of a supply chain. It is um one of the world's largest social protection architecture that is

available and touching the lives of millions. I would rather say each and every individual or a citizen of a nation is touched by one of these two systems either a consumer protection or

a public distribution system. Over the years, India has evolved a lot has initiated multiple digital transformation journeys across different different states and central government

which include digitizing the fair price shops, integrating the biometric authentication, enabling portability, build large scale digital infrastructure

in many ways. So the foundation for the transformation is on the move. We are not at we already have reached a level where we are ready to take up a further transformation journey to AI integrating

it for efficiency, transparency and scalability. And despite all these developments that have happened in the sector, we still have certain challenges staring at us.

And it is not about these are the issues because of any problem. These are because of the scale that we operate and the complexity that we encounter in day-to-day operations is what making it

more complex. Now the issue is not about availability. The issue is about efficiency, transparency and dignity of delivery. What are the structural challenges that

still are staring at us in the PDS and uh consumer protection space? There are certain leakages here and there. It's not because of any other reason. It's because of the complexity

of the operational issues that we have and the volume of operation that we are taking up. It's million tons of transactions and transfers happening day in day out. And then the static

allocation models instead of with the changing and dynamic economic realm that we are living in the logistics network it's too large for a human to comprehend and monitor very effectively

and beneficiary database. So the economic changes that are happening in a real time have to be updated and to be brought into the system so that effectively we are addressing the need

of the citizens not just a regular allocation that is going on or a static kind of a situation. And then we have also have a rapid

urbanization and migration which is posing further challenges in the public distribution system. The governance systems often rely on information not on predictive intelligence. probably that

is where the point of infliction that we currently are at where we should look at moving into a proactive and predictive analytics objective based decision support and I'm sure the topic that

we're going to talk about the solutions that are being implemented at multiple places are going to throw light on the possible solutions that can counter all the challenges that we are talking about

Now the artificial intelligence is what we are going to talk about. It allows us to move from excuse me reactive governance to predictive governance. While many nations are using

AI for predicting hunger and supply chain disruptions to counter the hunger, while we have an opportunity to move to a next level and have a

AI system that ensures the food actually reaches the right citizens at the right time with scale and efficiency With this I'm going to invite um now let me give a brief introduction or a overview of the

panel. The panel members today we have are from three different uh spectrums. One is the we have policy leaders, we have innovators and we have global

transformation partners which is a rare convergence of those who share policy build solutions and drive implementation on the ground. With this let's begin what I believe is

not just a discussion on technology rather a conversation on the future of welfare delivery itself. So I would request um madame uh Nur Aay Rias is engineering engineer by education and I

is officer of 2018 batch currently serving in a key leadership role in the civil supplies administration of Andhra Pradesh. Ma'am I have few questions to ask you.

Ma'am, I would like you to throw some light on the initiatives that the state has already been taken related to AI and associated technologies in uh food and public distribution and consumer

grievance redressal systems. If you can throw light on that. Uh so traditionally the public distribution system has faced challenges uh with respect to leakages, inefficiencies, manual monitoring and

very limited uh realtime uh oversight. So in order to cater to these challenges, the department of food and civil supplies, government of Andhra Pradesh in uh with the support of our

technology partners, we have evolved a AI based smart warehouse monitoring mechanism wherein we are using video analytics to monitor the vehicular movement, movement of the personnels as

well as the inventory movement in and out of the warehouses. Secondly, we are also tracking in real time transportation of food grains. This is um being done through GPS- based

monitoring wherein it is enabling uh us the authorities to ensure that only legally registered and legally permitted vehicles are only permitted to enter into the warehouses. And it also the

system also has a feature of anomaly detection wherein we can identify the trips uh which were closed uh which were too short and which were too which were taking too long like more

than 24 hours for the vehicle to go from the source till the destination. Thirdly, we are also doing um a consumer awareness digital platform wherein we are also integrating the price

monitoring and forecasting uh uh activities uh which will help us uh in decision making as well as uh timely interventions uh can be carried out uh in the coming few weeks. The department

is also going to involve uh evolve a system of smart allotment of PDS uh wherein we will have a end to-end solution right from the allotment of food grains to the district till the

distribution of food grains to the end beneficiary. So the department on of of government of Andh Pradesh we are aiming to evolve a system of uh accountability wherein the system generates uh and

anticipates the problems which might occur which predicts and then uh invol enable us to have timely intervention as well as realtime supervisory oversight both at the field level and as well as

at the state level. Thank you ma'am. Uh ma'am, a small request. Uh maybe all the panelists if we can uh stand up, they would like to take a photograph of us which we should

have done at the starting. So uh ma'am you talked about uh predictive uh solutions kind of how do we understand what is the requirement and all right and accordingly building

the solutions. So um how do you see this transformation of governance from this uh existing system to evidence-based and uh objective and proactive governance system. What is the view on that?

So given the massive scale which uh with which the public distribution system operates uh we are distributing food grains to cres of beneficiaries on a monthly basis on a daily basis. So the

previous system the traditional system what we have involves a lot of uh manual inspections manual reporting which is highly resource inensive for a department which is uh which cannot

cater to these activities on a day-to-day basis. So now with AI we are moving towards as you rightly said evidence-based governance wherein our decisions will be based on the

continuous data streams rather than these periodic episodic manual inspections and checks. So u so in case for example in case of the warehouse monitoring system we can

in real time we can detect any unauthorized vehicular entry any unauthorized person's entry in real time and as a result of that we can alert our field functionaries who are working in

the field. uh so the person can the our field officer can visit the place of incident and he can review it and he can take corrective action based on that data.

Uh and not only this uh we with this we can also identify the places and locations where such anomalies such violations are being reported frequently so that we can correct uh those

activities also as a result of that. So we are looking at a a transparent system developing a transparent system with end to-end transparency and maximizing our operational efficiency also to plug the

leakages wherever it is happening as today uh in the entire supply chain right from storage to handling to transportation as well as the distribution of food grains to the last

mile beneficiary. &gt;&gt; Thank you ma'am. uh so the point that you have touched on is the uh vision based monitoring of the warehouses. So I will take this uh question from you next

question to uh Mr. Hardik. Hardik um is a CA by qualification and he's been implementing AI at multiple places. So um Hardik you've been doing this uh vision based monitoring of warehouses

right so what has been how how how effective is that and what are the challenges that you have faced while implementing it in Andra &gt;&gt; uh sure so firstly good afternoon to all

and I must say that uh it's very unlikely for uh the government authorities like APSCL right to really be uh that bullish on new techn technologies right because AI even large

enterprises are still at that stage of piloting with these technologies but seeing the government authorities doing it and actually taking it to the real world use cases it's very commendable

now talking about what exactly we have been doing and how does it really work and the challenges so when we talk about APSCS the Andra civil supplies department uh primarily we are talking

about almost 400 warehouses MLS points where which is attended by almost 15,000 Hales who are engaged into loading unloading of the goods which are coming and coming out and then there are almost

1500 fleets of vehicles moving ac across the states on the daily basis which you have to keep a track which particular say a registered vehicle is entering up which premises right

now to maintain that there have been sensitive infrastructure in place for years now right almost five six years there is sensitive infrastructure more than 2,000 cameras across all of these

these warehouses but then they were largely serving the purpose of recording right so you have the footage coming in and saving on the NVR or the storage devices as we call it with no

intelligence coming from it our job is how do we add AI layer on top of it so almost 2,000 cameras from 400 different locations getting streamed at the real time and then you have to run analytics

on top of it to track which all vehicles are entering or going out who all workers are there on the ground and what exactly are they doing Because say the payments to Homali is also based on the

activity they do right how how many say bags did you load or unload and that's how the payment is calculated so is it all there is a problem right that there are no workers on the ground but they

they are on the paper those things needs to be flagged right or if there are vehicles which are not registered as a contracted vehicle but it is entering a certain premise that also needs to be

flagged real time that okay this truck doesn't seem to be in our record right why is it there and why is it there for maybe a longer time and then the stocks right annually the department is taking

care of almost 1,200 cr rupees of stocks right so even say a 10% loss of that is a big value right and big loss to the loss to the exch so what we do is we built AI which can understand which all

vehicles who all workers are they registered or not registered and the different types of goods which are in the inventory right to be able to reconcile exactly that on a certain day

at a given time which all vehicles are entering are they matching with the registered records or not? Which all workers are there on the site and are they registered Himalayas or not? and

what all things are there on these stocks and not just that okay I see these 100 bags of maybe rice each one of them being 50 kg but also to be able to estimate that are these full bags or

half full right so that monicular estimation of what could be the volume involved in each of these stock items and then keeping an eye on the entry and exit points so that you know that what

is actually coming in going out so that type of real-time intelligence is what we provide every time there is any abnormality or anything suspicious that we see like that our AIC is across any

of these locations it will generate a real-time alert which goes to the field staff as well as to the central team that okay this is something that you might have to look into right and then

they take the corrective action and it's part of the log report that okay this is what all we attended or not attended in today's time now the challenge is these 2 cameras we are talking they do not

come from a single vendor right so there are five different types of vendors different types of cameras with no uniformity in the specifications use almost four to five different VMS

systems being used which you have to integrate to and then run AI on top of it and then running AI on top of 2,00 cameras real time is itself a huge task to solve right so that technology

challenge of how do we run analytics at real time at intelligence and being able to generate meaningful insights not raise false alarms uh because that is something which will definitely piss off

the on ground people that okay you say there is a vehicle but I don't see a vehicle on the ground so to avoid those false cases that's been something of a great challenge that we have solved over

the period and thankfully the solution is working well now. There have been meaningful insights that we have been delivering to the uh to the team and that's what we are solving for.

&gt;&gt; Excellent. Excellent. That's that's phenomenal. So um one you're doing it with civil supplies corporation. What are the other areas where this kind of a solution can

scale and what kind of other problems this can solve? &gt;&gt; Uh sure. So so far we are doing it for the MLS points right which is in the entire supply chain of just the PDS it's

just one point uh the logical step would be to maybe go one step behind or one step further that can we also have this installed in like the same sort of analytic systems in the central

warehouses where the larger where say from where the goods are getting shipped to the MLS points and then also to one go one step further is for the fair price shops right there are endless as

ultimate distribution points. A lot of potential leakages might be happening at that point, right? Because that's where you're dealing with large public and of course there there are not many systems

in place. You're dealing with large number of such outlets to manage. So that is going to be a natural extension. Also on the technology side, the one piece that we have solved that when you

have so many analytics coming from such large videos, you really may not want to click that. Okay, show me what happened, right? You just want to chat. Nowadays we as a generation are getting trained

to chat instead of clicking and therefore what we have also built as a capability is what we call semantic search. Uh so instead of you going that okay tell me what all h happened or like

you trying to manually discover how about you having a chat assistant where you can say that okay tell me all the abnormalities that happened in the last 1 hours uh and which have not been

attended and the AI will answer that okay these are the five things but then the staff took more than 10 minutes to solve this right you might want to be aware of these so those semantic search

capabilities and then expanding it in the entire uh life cycle of TDS is going to be the natural extension of what we are Okay, that's that's perfect Hardik. Uh so you have talked about the fixed

places where the monitoring happens. Maybe a food for thought if you can monitor even the logistics just think over it and that will solve the larger problem and transit related concerns. So

um I'll move from uh the image or the visual based uh AI modeling to my next question is to Adita. Aditya Vardan is founder of Exolabs. Uh the tagline is building accurate

decentralized intelligence which is a very interesting uh tagline. So um Adita institutionalization of reg memory of an government institution is something which is very very important uh because

of the dynamic uh changes that happens in the institutions right so the work that you are doing with AP civil supplies is something related to that is what my understanding is so can you

please explain uh what exactly is that and what are the use cases that you are able to uh uh implement and what has been the impact of that on the functioning of the corporation and

department. &gt;&gt; Sure. Uh so uh firstly thank you for this opportunity. Uh so our use case essentially when we started off was pretty simple right you upload an Excel

file filled with surveys and uh you get an analysis out of it. However, um what we tried to do was when the analysis comes out, you factor in the sort of policies and guidelines that have

already existed for years. So when we started doing that, we understood the fact that institutional memory is very fragile. Um there is um transfers which are constantly happening, geos get

suspended and things like that. So what we thought was to put up an intelligence layer between the user and also this past knowledge that one would have that could give people the sort of efficiency

to take decisions with. Right? So once we started doing that uh the once officers started using this what we realized was although this was built for surveys and analysis of surveys they

started using it for things like generating an FIR template performing cross policy research and trying to analyze what is what are those factors or policy decisions based on which it is

something is working or not working from a survey perspective which would essentially give people deeper insight and It is also something that takes a lot of manualage to do by by a data

science team or somebody right. So in essence um when you put up uh sort of intelligence on a structured knowledge that is what addresses even the problem that ma'am

was saying uh key you need to give me evidences of what the answers are and how I need to trust them and things like that. So when that happens uh your speed with which you're taking decisions

improve the efficiency of decision- making improves and also the regulations remain pretty consistent across uh different regions as well. So that is what we noticed when uh we try to do

this an LLM on top of institutional memory. &gt;&gt; So um you must be doing a lot of backend verifications for this models to run effectively right?

&gt;&gt; Yes. So what are those uh things that you do in the back end to make it more um accurate uh and consistent &gt;&gt; right? So uh security in something like this is two-faced right one is

definitely the data privacy query privacies and all that sort of stuff. However, uh what we have been lately seeing is also this problem of hallucinations that is coming up wherein

uh companies are facing millions of dollars of losses based for the uh reports that they are generating and things like that. However, u loss of money is okay at a certain degree but

for PDS it essentially means hallucination essentially means that a family is not going to eat for a week or 10 days or whatever. So that is not something that you would want to happen

right. So um and therefore what we believe is you have to build uh systems on which you can blindly trust because a human layer of verification is always going to be there but the system has to

do its job accurately when um when when something is coming out of it. Now how does this trust get built right? There are primarily three factors based on which trust is uh sort of uh built on.

One is you need to be clearly able to see what the what the thought process the chain of thought of the model is before it gives you an answer on what basis it is giving on what is it reading

and things like that. Then secondly you need to be able to deploy it on onremise as an on-premise solution. The data shouldn't be going anywhere. And thirdly, most importantly, you need to

be able to customize and train the model at the local level. For example, uh an officer sitting in Gontour would have a lot more detail on the intricacies of how things function even after you

incorporate the unified intelligence as a framework. Right? So these three capabilities is what builds in trust into a system and u that essentially is what we are trying to do at Vexolabs

wherein we solve this at two different layers. One is to build models that can look at data and sort of give you the quality answers along with citations and other is by focusing more on the

existing research and science that has already happened for all these years which is essentially machine learning and deep learning on vectors and all that sort of stuff wherein you rely on

the traditional approaches a lot more and you cut down the reliance on LLMs and SLMs and all that sort of stuff or the third fact the third thing that you can do is focus purely on the SLMs build

SLMs that can reason by themselves and since they'll be focused you're more likely to get an sort of accurate cited outputs and uh things like that. So that is what we do sir.

&gt;&gt; Thanks. Thanks uh a lot. Uh now I'll move to Para. Para is also is from RNIT AI solutions. He's uh chief technology officer. So um para also you are also implementing LLM with a different use

case with civil supplies corporation right? So um you have been doing uh computer vision also and LLM also at multiple departments and multiple states. So what are those uh use cases

before getting into the specific that what we are doing in Andra if you can give a broad overview a quick overview of what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Sure. So uh we have been working closely

with egovernance uh across India with uh various state departments and uh in peak COVID we started uh with a FRS based solution to identify the

sanitation workers and then we extended it to uh students and uh teachers in school education which u by itself had an impact of um identifying more than few lakhs of go students and eliminating

um 100 crores of leakages. So we then transition to pension uh pensioner identifications and and the beauty of it is that the entire solution is uh uh edge based. So there is no internet or

uh power dependencies. So with a small smartphone uh the entire identification of the beneficiary is happening. So in the fair price uh distribution also this can be implemented

uh so that all the distributions uh can happen in a timely fashion without uh any disruptions and the in this growing age of AI uh the user privacy is something which comes

first. So uh our solution is also DPDP compliant because none of the biometrics of the user ever leaves the phone. It is u all the AI processing happens at the

edge and u in health department we have also uh done a vision based uh solutions. So basically CCTVs are majorly used for uh reactive purposes rather than proactive measures. But uh

in government uh hospitals uh using the same CCTVs we were able to monitor any sanitation security or uh pest control issues and proactively alert the required uh people and uh take the

necessary actions. Okay. So uh in uh civil supplies AP this is largely to do with uh PDS system authentication. So next level of biometric authentication uh can I say is

what you are implementing. &gt;&gt; Uh that is something in the plans and also uh one one other solution which we have currently implemented in AP civil server services is uh the natural

language based querying. So basically all the uh stakeholders always want uh the information at their fingertips. uh though there are a lot of MIS dashboards present but all the information is never

available on it uh and for let's take an example if a stakeholder wants to increase uh the ratio of female dealers uh in the fair price shops so they would like to know how many uh what is the

current distribution of male to female in the fair price shops and that also district-wise uh division is required. So all of this normally uh they have to rely on an MIS

person who runs the complex queries to extract the information. But now with just uh natural language they can um type in give this inputs and get the information and also they can get

district wise distribution and in which districts they would actually have to improve those things. So any information which is already in the database without muchuh effort they would be able to get

it. And we have also made the solution self-healing so that in case the query uh is misplaced then automatically it learns it understands what are the tables and it reruns it and gets the

right output always. &gt;&gt; interesting &gt;&gt; the uh potential uh next point for this is conversational AI. So we are taking it to the next point so that instead of

typing they can directly converse uh with the data and I think uh the future of citizencentric services will will be highly reliant on conversational AI. uh in this aspect I would like to give

another example which we have uh implemented recently in skill department in AP. Uh there is no uh lack of skill uh good skill set in Andhra Pradesh. Uh but the point is the employability has

to be increased that is you know creating a good resume or uh facing the interviews without fear. So for that we gave solutions like converse with the bot and have your ATS ready uh resume

created converse with the an AI aar and prepare for your mock interviews and get your interviews done. So this kind of conversational AI is something which we are working on and we think it will have

huge imple implementations in citizencentric services in PDS also. At RNI it we feel that AI is supposed to enable the humans not replace them and our solutions speak for that. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Superb. Super nice to know that. Uh now uh from PDS let's move to the consumer uh angle of it. uh when we talk about consumers the first thing is about uh price stabilization and how much the

consumers are actually spending on their essential food items. So um my next question is to Lakshmi Wenut co-founder and CTO um a real variable digital asset services private limited.

Uh Wenut, you are working on uh market intelligence as uh one of the tools which is uh very dynamic and uh multivariate kind of modeling that requires to understand how the prices

are moving and it is a challenging uh task for most of the government entities. Uh it has uh double impact. one the consumer spend is increasing and the second one it hits

the inflation at a economy level. So how the predictive modeling you are able to implement in essential commodity price analytics and what has been the impact of that in making a decision by the

department in stabilizing the prices. &gt;&gt; Great uh Kalyan thank you so much. Good afternoon everyone. The biggest uh outcome or the benefit of moving from a price

monitoring to looking at predictive intelligence is the fiscal efficiency at a state level or fiscal efficiency at a national level. How do we get to the fiscal efficiency?

It requires preemptive intervention. For the preemptive intervention to happen, you would require lot of data. the data that has so many variables that you have to consider definitely in terms

of modeling in terms of looking at weights to the parameters and this is all different data sets. So there is time series data, there is historic data and then there is live data and this

data injection that happens daily from the raub bazars or the mandis or like you know the general markets that comes in every day. Apart from that there is a terrific job

done by the department in terms of giving us almost 7 to 10 years of historical data not just in terms of prices but in terms of buffer stock release as well and buffer stock

management as well. So that helped a lot in terms of looking at how do we create these models and then believe me it's not one single model you know that gives the output it's a combination of three

or four different models that work in unison to be able to do that but end of the day what is important is the governance to get that preemptive intervention trigger onion prices are

rising over the period of 5 days about 10% the model predicts it can go 20% up. So the alert goes you may have to look at buffer stock release. Right now there is another commodity where the prices

are falling below and then it is going to breach MSB which is on the other side of the spectrum and which means that you know government has to procure so that the farmers and you know the the supply

chain is not affected because of that. So you have to look at both ends of the spectrum you know when you're looking at solutioning like this. So that has been our experience and then believe me there

are three variants that we need to look at. There are temporal shocks, there are steady uh inflation related issues that comes in and also you would probably know that there is also coordinated

manipulation as well. So you will have to understand these patterns to be able to alert you know which is which with a reasonable confidence. So um now you have been implementing

this for maybe certain commodities right knowing the complexity of each commodity each food product and the factors influencing the prices it's going to be very complex now my only worry is about

how do we scale it to multiple commodities so that as a basket I'm able to take a view and uh be able to uh manage the inflation Well and also the protect farmer's interest.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Today we are managing 75 variants across all the districts in Andhra Pradesh. So these are vegetables which have shelf life. There are pulses, there are edible oils and then within

these there are multiple variants that we have and each of these have their own seasonality. Each of these have their own crop cycles, their own yield patterns and

their own u you know for the the issues related to the farmers you know in terms of uh the yield that gets affected because of this. So these are some of the inputs that you know we definitely

have to consider when we look at the output. But apart from that what we are also discussing is scenario modeling right and stress testing. How do we do the scenario modeling and stress testing

so that we are able to so currently the output or the efficiency is about 85%. How do we bring it over 90 so that we can reduce 5% of false positives because end of the day every false positive

requires a governance decision right so how do we reduce that that is also a very important aspect so and we definitely are looking at ways and means in terms of looking at uh the models

that look at uh that that look at uh just give me a minute I'm looking at my notes so the models that are looking at uh say time series forecast, gradient boost, uh flow-based analysis, right? So

these are some of the things that you know that are important. At the same time, how do we make the government become a anticipatory market participant?

That is the most important aspect that you know how we are looking at the transformation uh related to this. But end of the day AI recommends, governance decides. It's an interesting statement.

Um Lakmat the anticipatory market participant. Let me let's have a discussion on that later. So taking it forward. Um my next question is to Nomi Hashimoto. Uh Nomi is deputy country

director with United Nations World Food Program. So uh Noi you have heard what are the initiatives that are taken up in um India with respect to AP. uh can you give a overview of what are

those few two three uh AI related activities which are relevant for public distribution or consumer affairs which are there in global markets which can be adopted.

&gt;&gt; Sure. Thank you very much for the question and I have to confess when I first got that question my answer was well India is quite ahead. There aren't that much that can be aspirational for

the Indian market. So that I I have to really mention there's a lot that other countries are looking to in to learn from India and that is the reality. Now the world program we do a lot of food

distribution in emergency context. It may not be necessarily fit perfectly in the PDS context but at that level what we do because we have operations over 100 countries one what's important which

we predict where the next big uh food shortage might come. So there is a real data coming in for the climate and agriculture production mechanisms 247 we monitor about 90 countries food security

situation and as far as like 60 days in advance there's a lead flag coming up then the entire machinery starts to move to start procuring commodities for that particular localities start transporting

and prepositioning so that's prediction is definitely one thing the other is when something happens how quick we can assess the situation and for that we use the satellite imaginary that is being

analyzed by AI. So maybe that's something uh potentially interesting when there is a big disaster hit like a big massive scale flooding or the earthquake before we constitute the

technical experts visiting the sites visiting the locations. It all took a couple of weeks for us to figure out how much you know stuff is needed where etc. But now we can do all these analysis

with AI within 48 hours. So these are some of the interesting uh qu uh you know examples that I would like to share. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh thank you Nami. So with

the experience that you have that is happening in India. What do you think is the right approach uh to have this AI implementation especially in the social sector and food

security space uh that can be adopted uh by uh India. &gt;&gt; Sure. Thank you. So I have the pleasure of being a part of this Indian ecosystem for the last two and a half years and

wow within the two and a half years how much has happened in terms of the modernization of the PDS. We have the pleasure working with the department of food and public distribution at the

national level as well as the state levels. We have done the nationwide supply chain optimization. We have introduced the anaprin ATM machines. By the way, those machines are showcased at

the expo. So, if you have chance to visit the expo, please also visit our store. And then also we have uh some other uh panelists already mentioned, but we have also tested uh the CCTV AI

powered uh smart warehousing etc. Now, why within a couple of uh years so much innovations can take place? That's because of the complementality by different partners. WP has the pleasure

to bring in our expertise, global experiences but also our technical understanding and then of course we partner with private sector who has specific technology skills. We have a

huge partnership with IIT Delhi to sort of uh you know develop some specific algorithm etc. And then of course the government's uh strong leadership to bring forward take people together make

it work. So I would say I was looking at this nice uh uh logo welfare for all happiness of all. I feel like our panel topic is very much relevant for this but I would also add efforts by all that way

we can bring a lot of things together. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you uh Numi. Um my next question I'll um we will get into a different topic now from the financing perspective of AI implementation. Uh

with us we have Tesa Matthew South Asia lead disruptive technologies and wi capital with IFC Tesa's AI solution adoption requires a lot of funding and uh cost involved in

it to adopt at scale. So what is that IFC is looking at in that space and how are you planning the since you are in disruptive technologies? How do you look at this disruption to happen and IFC

support in this area? &gt;&gt; Sure. Thanks Kalyan. Uh so first of all I think AI adoption in government systems is not merely a technology challenge or a financing challenge. It's

actually an ecosystem challenge and this is where DFIs have a distinct and catalytic role to play. Uh firstly DFIs can help uh mobilize uh capital at scale uh for the EI ecosystem. So to give you

an example, a IFC has invested over $500 billion uh and supported over 200 plus Indian tech startups over the past decade or so directly and indirectly through its

venture capital investment program. but more broadly I think DFIs can use patient capital um also blended finance and risk sharing instruments to derisk early adoption uh be it in AI startups

or even in infrastructure like data centers uh and connectivity that governments can rely on. Secondly, DFIs can invest uh beyond uh AI solutions into capacity building as well as uh

standard setting. Um and as we all know uh successful AI deployment in government systems uh will require data governance, procurement uh reform, cyber security and skills within the

ministries and implementing agencies. So DFIs can finance technical assistance, training, uh change management to ensure that AI systems are actually used and maintained and trusted over time. And

third, by bringing together governments, global tech firms, um as well as local startups and implementing agencies, DFIs can help move from pilots to platforms uh to ensure that uh you know these

systems are interoperable, privacy preserving and aligned with uh public interest outcomes particularly in systems like uh food and u as well as social protection.

So um follow on uh Teresa is you have it's good to know that you invested like $500 billion in nurturing the startup ecosystem in technology that is specific to AI

is there any kind of a plug-and-play models or the use cases development the way like hackathons are happening uh now on digital adoption do you have any such thought on having those few use cases is

demonstrated and ready for adoption kind of thing. &gt;&gt; So in PDS and logistics I think AI models can actually be embedded across core operations. I mean in the last

decade we have seen significant uh reduction in grain losses in India's public distribution system through digitization and sim I mean the numbers are quite

staggering right and similarly even in logistics I think the costs have come down quite substantially over the last decade uh thanks to digitization and I think the next level of efficiency gains

will come from AI adoption and we've seen enough examples in the private sector Um so if you take demand forecasting for example there are companies like SATS

shore uh which use satellite imagery and AI uh to build predictive models that can help in procurement optimization uh as well as inventory monitoring and uh leakage detection. Um if you take

logistics for example, not specifically in the PDS context but you know more broadly there are companies like Intangles that have developed uh basically predictive maintenance

solutions building on AI technologies. Uh these can you know help prevent significantly improve logistics efficiency by reducing breakdowns, improving fuel efficiency,

uh load optimization as well as uh improving safety. And finally, I think there's been a lot spoken about computer vision AI, which has phenomenal applications in inventory

monitoring. Uh, you know, tracking both the quantity and quality of grain at uh entry and dispart point within within a warehouses. Um, and we've seen companies like

Arya.ag for example, uh, implement a lot of these technologies uh to improve their warehouse management operations. So I think and you know from everything that's been discussed looks like you

know there's a lot that's already there. Uh but yes there are lots of examples from the private sector I think which can find application in the PDS system. &gt;&gt; That's that's that's great to uh know.

So um we'll uh sum it up with uh nup just one your view on how this public distribution system uh can be a modern efficient and embedded with emerging technologies and what is

your view on how do you want to take it in uh Andra. Uh so we at government of Andhra Pradesh would like to evolve the public administration system public

distribution system into a citizenric ecosystem wherein we deliver quality food grains to the rightful beneficiary at the right time which will not only empower the citizens but also the

administrator and the government at large and and I feel it's it's not just about adopting new technologies it is more about strengthening and improving how the existing ing public distribution

system governs and for this we are also striving to to embed the accountability built into the system so that the officer can act faster and deliver better services for

our people. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much uh all the panelists and thanks audience for uh your patience uh audience for the session. Thank you very much.

Can we go for questions or it's &gt;&gt; okay? Thank you. Thank you a lot. &gt;&gt; Two minutes and I think by the time we get the moments we can take one or two

questions, right? &gt;&gt; Thankfully we have couple of minutes so we can take few questions. Can I Yeah, thanks for a nice session. Uh we are supply chain management

consultants. So we work in the area of digital transformation, SEM and sustainability. So uh recently we have also been working uh wherein we can provide some solution for the government

uh so uh in the area of you know uh in the area of digital transformation. So after hearing to you uh we were also looking if from our side from the private sector I would say so what is

the sort of scope we have so that uh as private partners we are able to provide our expertise in the area of digital transformation so that it can really you know give a lot of uh comfort uh to the

policies which the government is bringing in and how we can become the partner into that. So if you would uh like to uh like to comment on the same. &gt;&gt; Uh uh so um uh we the at the government

we are also procuring uh the paddyy from the farmers. We procure patty. So uh till now we have discussed the warehousing logistics and transportation. So with respect to

procurement also we would like to automate a few processes uh those activities can be can be discussed and can be uh taken forward. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much. So um I would request panelists to please accept the moment. Uh just yeah I would like request you to please hand

over the moments to the panelists. Ma'am Mr. Lashmi W. We'll start from this side. Nazomi Harik

Adipia. Pard. Now I will take the honor of presenting the momento to ma'am. much for coming in. Um I'll I'll

actually do a uh a very brief introduction of the panelists that we have. It's an esteemed set of panelists who have spent years in the industry and know a lot. Um there's a lot to learn

from them. U and I'll try to keep this session as much focused on learning uh right and learning from their experience. Uh before we start I'll maybe start the introduction. Um I'll

start with Hitesh. Hit heads the ICICI investment team. Uh right. Um they've been very active in this space. Um they've been doing investments. they're uh building a portfolio where they look

at new technologies and with ICICI backing them they also invest in technologies that work at scale right um so would be good to learn from Hesh how he sees this space um then we have Nidi

she's an industry veteran spent almost more than 20 years in the financial industry space and now is working with NetAbit um she heads their products and partnership where she focuses on how

they can enable sales for their customers right and um looking at new technologies in that space. Um then we have Chinme. Chinme is a partner at InfoEdge Ventures. He leads their

investments in the AI space as well as other investments. Um spent several years in the industry, was a startup operator himself and now is on the other side of the table. Then we have Rajie.

Um Rajiv uh is the CEO and MD at work expertise. U they are a solution provider for staffing solutions and technical solution providers to several of the leading brands in India and

they've been expanding uh really quickly in this space right I have been at the luxury of having worked with them directly as well so I'll try to bring that flavor in the conversations as well

right maybe Rajiv um I'll start with you right I think the topic for this session is voice as the default interface uh right? How is it that India is going to operate

and how is the next billion population in India going to come into this ecosystem? Right? And what role will voice play? Um I think you've been advising a lot of senior uh folks at

some of the biggest brands, right? Like Hero um what is your learning from the industry? Why is there a need for voice and what do you think are the gaps that it is filling which the current inherent

solutions are not able to do? So this is an interesting uh uh uh and a very broad uh uh context. So I'm going to narrow it down only for India as a context. So we will not touch uh uh and

if I'm quoting something keep in mind I'm quoting uh with reference to India and Indian uh uh population. So uh I think uh communication

voice communication is surpasses the literacy levels. So it's a uh uh it will get you out of the literary circle literacy illiteracy circle if you are able to get voice automated.

Now typical challenge which India faces and today if you look at a number uh we are uh let's say about 35 cr Indians will not be able to read and write. So your SMS

communications also do not work for them. So the only thing which will work for them is the voice. So if you have to bring the entire 1.4 4 billion people into the voice uh uh uh literacy. You

will have to overcome fairly acute challenges like grains. India has uh a sprinkling of accents. Even if you take just English, the

English spoken in Punjab, English spoken in Hana, English spoken in Bihar, English spoken in Tamil Nadu or Gujarat is different. It's their dialects are different there. So you have to train uh

people you come to Hindi same is the element of Hindi. So within uh Bihar if you go there would be at least four to five dialects. Now that nonsenses how are you going to get uh uh people to be

able to communicate clearly and get response in their language so they can trust which is very important because if they don't trust the communication they will not communicate what they want.

Second part which will be important the AI will really have to train themselves to be able to complete a transaction today. If you look at it most pilots most pilots which I'm seeing

are happening at a superficial layer. you know uh there is a still a confidence which is to be built up unless it gets into the action layer we will uh still be touching the surface

of voice as an AI. the people I deal with, the clients I deal with, all of them are very keen to go far and the most companies which pitch to them have international

examples to quote what benefits, what use cases, what business return uh ROIs they have been able to deliver. But the moment you come back to India, there is limitation. We started uh uh one

particular project about close to 5 years back you know and in that uh till date we have not been able to deliver uh the regional languages other than English and Hindi to the accuracy beyond

65 70%. And this is only speech to text reverse has not even come in this so that's the reality on the ground. So how are we going to come?

I think that's a challenge which organization like Gani and some of other organization will have to really work on. &gt;&gt; Thanks a lot Rajie. I think u you make a

fair point right because even though my parents are literate but they will still have challenges in navigating an app journey but tell them to talk to somebody they will instantly be able to

talk and figure out right so I think voice definitely unlocks a set of customers who earlier did not have access um right um maybe and then you mentioned there are several companies

right my next question would be to chinme he's been leading the investments at infoedge and I'm sure he sees several such companies Right. Um voice as the next frontier both on the

customer side of things as well as your investors in voice AI startup. What are you seeing in the market right like why is there enthusiasm and do you think that this enthusiasm will sustain and do

you think what happened in 2000 as we moved from physical to digital that digital to voice journey is going to happen now? &gt;&gt; Great framing uh Arunam great framing.

Um you see I remember from uh 5 years ago when you would call you know credit card customer care especially uh MX definitely had this feature. You could instead of uh typing in your uh 10digit

card number you could actually just say it out and the system would essentially understand with a degree of accuracy that was more or less satisfactory and that's how your journey with your

banking partner AMX or Siticardo or whoever would begin. The point that I'm trying to make to um essentially bring to light Arunab's question is that voice has probably been around for the better

part of a decade as an interface for human computer interaction. What has changed uh in the last year and a half or two or 3 years? Number one, is there a lot of enthusiasm? If you ask me

as an investor, perhaps there is way more enthusiasm than there should be. Just the number of companies that are getting uh funded in voice. The number of companies that the number of founders

that are starting out uh uh companies that are focused on voice AI. I wish you know everybody succeeds but that's simply not how you know the world works. That's not how the cookie

crumbles. So perhaps there's a little bit too much enthusiasm if you ask me. But you know uh that um cold dose of pragmatism a aside the reason why we see this sudden uptick in enthusiasm is

essentially uh that technology has come of age. You know how they say about technology that you know there's u you know decades go by and nothing happens and then there is a week or a month or a

year when it looks like decades worth of progress just manifests all of a sudden. I guess all of us every single one of us in this room has been living that accelerated dream in terms of everything

that AI has shown us is possible over the course of last two two and a half years. So in terms of the key technology pieces and perhaps you know we'll get a chance later to discuss this over the

course of uh this 1 hour or so um um different pieces like speechtoext um you know uh text to speech or ASR automatic speech recognition plus you know the ability to query data make

sense of it and return it in coherent natural language in other words let me just in a lazy way uh call it LLMs right all of these three technologies have come of age uh over the course of to

different degrees over the course of last year to three years right uh not to say that all languages have these three pieces developed or these uh you know text to speech and ASR developed as much

as English does but it's all happening at a rather quick pace of course u like Rajiv pointed out India is going to leapfrog a bunch of different technological stages Rajiv gave the

example of I think telephon and you know how we leap uh leap frog to mobile phones and so a vast part of our population is of course going to adapt to and adopt voice rather quickly. So

the two macro forces that are happening together is number one you know the uh you know hundreds of millions of Indians adopting this technology and number two the technology suddenly being so good

that instead of just being you know a rule-based rather lame conversational engine. These are now rather lifelike intuitive extremely rich conversations that the technology is enabling. These

two macro forces coming together means that uh founders are starting new companies and investors are throwing money at them. &gt;&gt; Fair point Jim. I think yeah I mean um

small joke that when I often visit customers they say okay this voice AI has also become like a city market. I have 100 options to choose from. Right. Um so I think yeah I mean you're right

the technology is coming of age. uh but I think what will differentiate in the next 2 three years uh uh players who are able to own this technology and not just build on top of it um shall progress

right um Nidi maybe moving on to you because you have actually firsthand implemented and started scaling up these technologies right um and Net Ambbit has consulted some of like largest companies

in terms of revenue growth and expansion right you've been consultants to growth Um how do you see voice AI as a growth enabler for an enterprise and like you've run the show you've seen some of

the initial results like what is your opinion in terms of just setting the vision that how are you seeing um this technology will be leveraged for growth. &gt;&gt; Sure. Um Ara uh a question which is very

close to my heart. uh you want me to describe NetAmbit's vision on um AI and especially voice AI. Net Ambbit has been uh accelerating offline business growth um using technology uh as as precision

and um uh and humans as as uh the radical change agents. Um honestly we have been able to build a world-class platform for hiring and sales uh by just placing right people in

the right place at the right time. Uh fast forward today um our clients are no more asking us how many merchants can you onboard. They want to know how many merchants can we retain? How can we

activate them? How can we reduce the turnaround times? How can we actually bring in efficiencies in terms of fraud detection? So um and coming to users, they have been using technology to

acquire customers. They really want to know how how can they use technology to retain customers. And for um uh for us at NetAmbit, this has a profound implication. uh we partner with our

clients as growth partners offering skill as a service uh distribution as a service, sales as a service but uh our vision is to add intelligence as a service. So um I think uh having said

this uh AI is no longer an option especially voice AI is no longer an option. Uh we really want to have uh uh become a company which becomes uh um an infrastructure for offline

market to be able to speak and hear. Every merchant who gets onboarded in our ecosystem, every customer who buys a loan from us. Um every agent who gets trained from us should have an AI

interface uh where he can uh talk to us uh complain to us uh grow with us actually upgrade themselves. Net ambit is currently into 900 locations 500 5,000 pin codes. We uh we hire people in

seven languages. Um uh I think uh this is not distribution. We do 20,000 tasks per day. Uh but this is not distribution. This is voice AI uh system I mean deployment highway which is

actually uh bubbling with urge to be activated. So uh we've done multiple uh PC's and we have found that voice AI is actually reaching the users where they are instead of let asking the users to

come halfway to use the technology. Wonderful point U Nidi. I think like you said right as we move from acquisition to retention the number of touch points that you do

with a customer needs to increase and become more meaningful. Setting humans to do it does not ensure the rigor and rhythm but setting AI agents will ensure that you are uh

touching base right. Um and uh hit I think um you sit on a mammoth organization such as ICIC. You have seen this industry in terms of the complexities. You work with some of the

largest consumer base in India, right? Uh what is your learning in terms of the insights of a bank? What are they most excited about voice AI? Which are the areas you're seeing that this has a

potential to really radically change operations not just have a step improvement right which are the areas where you feel that there's lot of excitement with this and some areas if

you can talk about from your experience where you've seen implementation happening &gt;&gt; yeah uh thanks uh today if you look at the voice searches on Google right uh

the total searches to the voice search on Google 20% of the searches on Google are voice searches And uh I feel that voice AI is a confidence layer. Uh it is a unified it

can become a your primary unified uh engagement layer or a communication layer uh for your end users. Uh many time the customers are not said about literacy. Many times there is a lack of

confidence in terms of putting a text messages or you know interacting with the mobile app or even you know writing an email. Not many customers are comfortable doing that right. So voice

AI liberates this phobia in terms of how do I engage and uh we have seen that voice AI and vernacular put together unless is a different kind of potential. So either to customers which were not

engaging with you, you were not able to map their behaviors, their insights or their requirements, all of them become the part of the mainstream through voice AI.

Secondly, voice AI can be a big uh DPI in the sense that it can be used as an authentication layer. Today you don't need OTPs, right? Uh and different sorts of authentic authentications. boys can

do that job really well. some of the use cases I will talk non-banking use cases which we are seeing uh you know a lot of uptakes is many uh startups like Sonia AI or rocket

health all of them are engaging with the patients they are all mental wellness apps where they're engaging with the patients through voice AI and understand they are able to

understand the tonality uh the you know and the anxiety behind behind the discussions they are doing through voice AI and they are able to guide them and coach them right

when it comes to enterprises uh voice AI per se uh is no more a speech recognition tool or it's no more a conversation tool it's more of a transaction and end to end solution

providing tool to us to give an example if you want to sell a low value product to a customer let's say I want to sell a insurance product which is a which has a premium of 500 rupees right

doing it through the army of phone banking officers would be you know would not be cost effective but through voice AI you can actually pitch a product with your prospective customer explain them

the features and not only that it doesn't stop there you also need to do back-end integrations you know with your systems your core banking wherein Then on the call itself, you take a consent.

If the customer is convinced with the product, you take a consent to debit the account. You take a consent to send them the policy through their email, through their email or any other registered

address you have. So that the end toend transaction gets consumed while you are on the call. So that's the level at which voice is moving to and that's where it also brings in huge amount of

efficiency in terms of your uh crosselling and the last point is about embedding it. I feel it will get embedded across right today uh you can embed it in your business you can do

shopping using voice AI. So think of wise AI as a very powerful channel to engage, communicate, cross-ell or sell through that channel and in times to come it will become one

of the most prominent channel for the enterprises. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I think um I'm sure the scale at which the Indian geography is right like with 1.4 4 billion people um servicing

them consistently through mediums such as SMS or even human agents will become more and more challenging. uh right so I think definitely and I mean like you said authentication and fraud detection

is a fairly large use case right with the incidence of fraud happening so rampantly if voice as an authentication and a secure authentication um it can definitely um give a lot of benefit

right um Rajie my next question to you now we've established that yes the next few years are going to be about voice technologies right But the idea is that everyone who's in this journey wants to

know what first how do we evaluate it and if we have evaluated it how do we scale it while we are scaling it how do you ensure that it does not break these are things that I'm sure that your

clients would come to you for guidance and expertise right um so if you could share some of that learnings where you see what are the use cases which have a very immediate ROI

And what are the guardrails or what are the checkpoints that you would look at while expanding voice AI? &gt;&gt; You know, I'll try and uh uh sort of take us back to the '90s

when uh internet started getting in and getting into businesses. I remember at Chadup the first online B2B e-commerce solution here in the country office.com uh getting the procurement to use

internet was a challenge the the CEO or the top management would generally feel if given internet they will only be surfing on all the other things rather than doing work you know

and it took maybe just few years and internet was all you know it penetrated and got into everything.

So very importantly the first task the technology companies have to work towards building the trust that it works and it is safe. So they will have to configure uh solutions which are

airgapped which internet companies did. So you had access to internet but you could only so through the firewall you could control what is accessed and you could monitor

what is being accessed. So you really had that uh uh guarded uh uh built over there. Similarly in this you will have to create models which will be kind of you we will call today SLM uh I'm uh not

going to any term right now because this will evolve in next one year not maybe next six months no you have a new term which will come up. So how are you going to build that trust? That's one. The

moment the trust builds up then scaling becomes easier. So today when we look at use cases uh the use cases are quite many but normally low impact to get the confidence that it works. It has an

accuracy. Still when you're bu building heavily guardrail data as well the response which comes to the same query in a gap of 5 minutes is different. So that's not trust which customer is

getting. Ideally when you are working with an technology like this which is so intelligent if I'm throwing a query now and I throw the same query same words after five minutes it should throw back

the same query to me or same query and asking me something that okay you want more I can give you more what happens on the uh chat GPT or something like that so

coming back we need to see how you can build trust and that's what we do through a lot of PC's happen pilots happen a lot So we have multiple pilots running we have PC's happening you know

and then they will see whether they want to take it forward to a full-blown because the moment you get into full-blown what just said there's lot of integration required in the PC or pilot

stage you do some uh uh uh maybe 15% 20% integration uh happen but full-blown means now I'm committed and I'm going to go live with it for life that call I don't think so any digital

transformation manager is ready to commit today. That's uh uh what I would say. So if you want to rebuild scale, focus on how do you give them the guarantee that this is trustworthy

response and response is controllable to the way the organization wants. &gt;&gt; No, I I I think that's correct. Um Rajiv like in and from my personal experience once they see a technology doing

conversations consistently in a very guarded manner uh then it's just a matter of scaling those conversations but unless if even a single conversation is going wrong uh the risk is that one

person can become 2% 5% so how do you tightly monitor it right I think that's that's very important &gt;&gt; if I can add to you know what Rajiv said You know when you are uh interfacing

with the customers right in banking we say that the innovation is welcome &gt;&gt; but customer trust is non-negotiable. &gt;&gt; Right. And uh just to give you an anecdote right one of the company's

management gave a mandate to the technology team that you create a voice bot which is a very customerfriendly voice bot. any customer who calls us, it should be able to help the customer and

resolve their queries in a very friendly manner. That was the mandate given to the technology team. So they created a nice voice bot. One of the customers called up uh the voice B and uh he was

very frustrated, irritated customer. He said, "I'm uh I want to file a complaint against your company and I want to file a legal case against your company because I'm very frustrated with your

service." The voice board replied stating that sir no problem uh we will help you find some good lawyers to file a complaint against us. So because the mandate was that it

should be a customerfriendly voice right. So talking about guardrails when you you know make an application which is enterprise grade privacy security accuracy becomes par of

paramount importance. You actually need to know on which data the underlying models are trained. Do they have any biases? And if you know uh uh there are biases, what are the frameworks you are

creating to ensure that those biases don't crippen while the customer conversations are happening or customer engagements are happening? And when you as a organization,

you know, you're putting your brand at stake, right? when you open up these channels and conversation starts free flowing this actually impacts you know your brand. So you have to be very

cautious when uh you are exposing some of these tools and technologies and innovations to the customers. &gt;&gt; We had a case in Australia &gt;&gt; where uh the Australian government uh uh

had a report from one of the big fives &gt;&gt; and the report was faulty. It was all used and they had to pay a a huge fine and redo the whole report again. So very important point the enterprise data uh

has to really come out accurately otherwise uh that trust will not come out you know simple uh uh uh points you know one of the use cases which we were piloting rather P is going on not even

pilot started where the the product name in Hindi is just not coming right just not coming right we have tested almost all the LLMs there including whatever is happening in India

you name it and we have tested it's just not coming right it's a little tricky so what do we do &gt;&gt; the word &gt;&gt; so

then the customer said no let's wait till the technology mature then we'll come back so those are some of the nances which are going to come up when you going to

roll out uh voice BS and this will this year I would say 26 is going to be a confidence building year you will have lot of pilots having lot of PC's happen uh lot of LLMs get trained and new LLMs

will come out I definitely going to come out because all the there's other issue which is there what training has happened last 3 four years is all corrupted data now what is getting

thrown will also be a challenge Yeah. No, I think um yeah, use cases need to be implemented in a very guarded manner, right? And I think in our experience when we've been working with

clients, right? Obviously, you start with a smaller base, right? You start with let's say automating 100 calls, 200 calls, 500 calls and you gradually do that confident confidence building

phase. And maybe uh Nidhi you can talk from experience, right? Um when do you get enough confidence or are there certain use cases which are more relevant in this technology and then you

implement and scale up wise AI there and then there are certain use cases which could be something like a customer support right where uh guardrails need to be heavy um and therefore you wait

till the technology matures right but there are certain cases where the technology is mature enough to execute these actions There are certain use cases where it's a wait and watch and

then there are also certain use cases where it's really fast hypers scaling because you feel that there is it has reached the intended target. &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. So uh Arnabai agree

with uh Rajie and where uh lot of training lot of uh optimization needs to be done on on voice solutions. However, in my experience, I've seen that few use cases for example um u audits uh to a

certain extent can still be automated using voice solutions, voice conversations. Um so we do uh manual audit welcome calls to our merchants who get onboarded. We've got absolutely

amazing results using voice solutions through Guani. We also face the problem of pronunciation of names. But I think we could tweak it to a level which gave us uh at least less than 10% false

positives. Uh we could actually bring in um I would say non-negotiable parameters on board which were u like um these solutions were not just working in demo environment they were working on

the field. So we have uh as as I mentioned earlier we operate in 900 plus cities. So we h and in India we don't switch languages we actually weave it into our mother tongue. Uh Hindi spoken

in a Gujarati manner, Hindi spoken in a um in a mali style. So uh we worked a lot on that. Um I think uh the way forward is still u I mean we are still to see the high accuracy there but the

tool is learning fantastically. So uh you know welcome calling hiring uh another very important pertinent use case uh where uh we strongly feel that voice AI voice solutions if trained well

if technology is used optimally well I think they can do wonders. Um so what happens in a communication it's not one call it's it's multiple conversations happening at one time at various levels

if you talk to a few people they talk to you in a very emotional way others talk to you in a practical way is your AI solution trained enough to actually figure out the sentiment of the call is

the maker or the breaker of the accuracy of your solution. So the more you give sentiments, emotions, stress, tonality to your training, the better your agent will become. hiring, end-to-end hiring,

talking to the customers, asking the preferred role, asking the salary, uh, you know, preferred mode of communication till, um, uh, till he actually generates interest, moving to

the KYC stage, generating an offer letter, giving him a uh, reminder call before the joining date, asking him how is, you know, um, wishing him all the best on the day of joining. I think

these are all possible using AI. Um we've also tried and tested in um um in cases of BFSI lending um I think activations um that that's the space where you need to

be a little more compliant. You need to understand the OTPs cannot be asked on phone calls. So uh very clear guard rails and in use cases very clear indicators where an automated call will

help versus a human in loop is the decision uh which every every digital transformation head or the manager has to take. very wonderful point Nidi. I think you

also mentioned that false positives right um I think the moment the cost of false positive is something that you can handle then that's an area where voice AI can scale up if your cost of a false

positive like you said in the case of a lending journey you miscommunicate an information there is a higher cost associated with it in the case of a hiring journey a cost of a

miscommunication is not that high right so I think Wherever you see that you can work with a minimum threshold of false positives, those are areas where you can rapidly change volumes from a human

agent to an AI agent. Areas where you feel that we need to bring down the cost of those or bring down the false positive rate. There you learn, teach the system and sort of scale it up.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. And it's not about actually automating everything. It's augmenting. um your callers are supposed to do uh the intelligent work. They're not

supposed to ask monotonous question on every call and get actually very exhausted. So um in in a use case where we are selling uh upskilling courses, it's it's working beautifully. It never

feels exhausted. It it talks to the uh to the prospective learner in the same passion. So um I mean there are uh teen use cases where voice solutions work beautifully well and others are like on

the way to be compliant and to be trained. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Perfect. Chin over to you like I I think you've seen with Info Edge you've seen they

they've been the pioneers of technology when no came out then with 99 acres and then with Zomato as an investment right you've seen um I would say in short of a better word legendary companies right

who have changed how the industry operates um what do you think will take uh to create a legendary voice AI company, right? And what are the key areas that

as customers also who are evaluating these voice AI companies, they need to look out for when they're choosing a partner for such &gt;&gt; Arun. In our experience, there is very

little uh that you can do forward looking to build a legendary company. I mean you try and do basic things. You try and sell a little bit. You try and solve three customer problems. You try

and stay ahead of the technology curve a little bit here and there. And hopefully along the way you meet a little bit of luck and some degree of current guidance. And that's how eventually you

look back you know 17 years uh from you know that point in time and you say oh my god legendary company. uh you know uh it's very difficult to connect the dots looking looking ahead to um I don't

really know what it will take to build a legendary company in VCI um I do not know what will be sufficient to build a legendary company I do have some idea around what will be absolutely

necessary so for example um there's a lot of conversation that I see from potential buyers of AI boys AI other AI products around ROI um around you know whether the

expenditure or the investment in EI is justified by the savings that um that initiative will drive. I'm not a big fan of that conversation. I don't necessarily like um having conversation

around how AI will drive savings. I don't think AI um I don't think AI should be conflated for a cost cutting exercise. It should be thought of as an investment that compounds over time. The

question is not how much money AI will save for you this year. The question is not what will be the ROI on it. The question is can you really afford to not do it even if it's a rather questionable

ROI right now. That's really the question. the greatest voice AI companies will be able to elucidate that point to the customers so that they don't fall

into the race of you know undercutting pricing and you know giving freebies and giving you know extensive free demos and whatnot given that it's a crowded space. So being able to impress that point upon

customers that's going to be an important one. The second important one again necessary but likely not sufficient is the core technology. I do believe that the ideal voice company

will own every single piece of the technology. I'm not just talking about the three key building blocks of uh speechtoext uh TTS and the LLM but I also mean the

more basic aspects around you know telephony and dialing and orchestration and you know QA and analytics and the dashboard associated with it. Every single piece needs to be owned by the

company. The problem maybe not the problem maybe the good thing with AI is that you know you um as a customer you bring on an AI product today and it is absolutely

state-of-the-art. it is cutting edge and you go to sleep for 3 months and you realize, oh my god, I'm really stuck with a product that is from back in the '9s because AI really is moving at a

pace that is blinding fast and therefore for a voice AI company to say that I'm actually using an API of one of these hyperscalers, I'm dependent on a whisper API of OpenAI or an Amazon and so on so

forth, you know, that's simply not going to cut it. The third thing that is going to be important is I see a lot of focus amongst Indian startups to go and win outside India. I really think that's not

a battle you should be fighting. I don't even think honestly it's a battle that you deserve to fight. Unless you have won India first, there's no reason why you should be looking to uh you know

score these points outside India. Now India especially for voice AI it is an incredibly difficult market because some of the points uh you know that uh my

fellow panelists made earlier just the number of languages dialects people accents whatn not it's extremely difficult and therefore being able to find depth in a specific language as

opposed to breadth across five different languages that is going to be important so I don't want to hear a voice say I company tell me that you know I have 80% accuracy of ASR across 12 different

languages. Have you cracked English in the Indian accent first to a degree of 96% accuracy? That's a conversation I'd much rather have. And then let's go solve for Hindi and then let's go solve

for Tamil and then let's go solve for Bangla and so on. Right? And even if that journey takes a little bit longer, even if this journey sounds like a year and a half, two, three years journey

just to solve the core technology of these different languages. What is the hurry? Anyway, you know, uh, quote unquote legendary companies take like good 15, 17, 20 years to make,

right? So, you know, the ability of the founders to actually just sit back, relax, take a deep breath, solve for the technology in a way that you are not to use uh Modi G's

phrase that in a way that you're at Nurbar that you're not really relying on one of these hyperscalers. I think that is going to be the other important one. The fourth and last point I'll add again

it has been uh mentioned by my fellow co-panelists is uh you just aspects of observability safety security um data unification building the right pipelines building the right linkages

making sure that the voice AI product is connected to every single piece in the technology stack so that you know it is able to access customer data and so on right I think that's going to be super

important too I have seen a lot of companies that have beautiful demos Such demos that you will be blown away. Oh my god, that sounds so humanlike. So much so that you cannot just you can not

just hear the voice AI talk, you can even hear the voice AI breathe. The demo is that good. But you know your best laid plans as soon as they get tested in real production world that is when those

bestlaid uh plans fall off. So having an eye towards what doing what production does at a scale to your beautiful nifty piece of technology I think that's going to be an important one too.

No, I think uh brilliant answer China Chai you touched about scale having the proprietary tech right because I think what we're also seeing in the market with this data residency

and lot of the acts coming in in terms of information security uh you relying on API wrapper means that your information is going out and unless I mean just today in the summit

discussions people are saying okay I don't want a single piece of data to go out of my ecosystem let alone a cloud. I want this all within my infra. Uh, right. So there's no way you like tech

is not building a tech is not an option. It's the only thing that makes voice AI scale up. Right. I think that's very well put. Maybe just as we are closing down few uh closing thoughts I think

from the panelists in terms of where would your advice to the CXOs and the leaders be in terms of how do you approach voice AI and what should you do in the next oneear time frame um and

maybe the next five years in terms of how do you go forward with voice AI? See uh I think uh there is no escape you have to try test and move forward. So you have to go through the journey of

learning. Uh the ERP days of again I will remember remind people 87% failure rate in the first time rollout you know. So uh today also if you go to SMB market they are still stuck on tally some level

of automation. There is a journey you will have to go through. One, when you look at a partner very rightly mentioned, you should look at a partner who's there

to stay, who is focused on your market, who's not your market is not an option for him. So I I have met companies who are focused on international market because

profits are higher and all and they've been there for some quite some time but they've not focused on Indian market. So if you really want the best buck or rather best out of your buck is focus

on companies which are there to stay who are building to keep the company and not to sell the company. Second, they are sensitive to the requirement of trust which the Indian

business mindset has. If you talk to a uh uh uh global enterprise and you talk to an Indian global enterprise, you will have a complete different requirements coming out around data security.

So keep that in mind. So uh and then finally I think uh uh start small and then take it large. So as this year is going to year of change. So use this year as a learning. Spend

some money. You will have to invest when you set up a factory or any set of business you invest in something. Now you're setting up a new capability which you're definitely going to give you

returns in future. So but you have to invest today. If you look at return of in uh return on investment now I think then you should not look at it. Um it's probably not my place to give

advice to CXOs but if I may share a small piece of advice it's honestly got nothing to do with uh the companies the enterprises they are running. My only advice will be uh use as much of AI as

you can in your own personal life. I mean if we are all still using chat GPT as a question and answer sort of platform and if we are thinking instead of you know you doing our searches on

Google we now do our searches on chat GPT so we have now become AI savvy the fact is we are not necessarily even scratching the surface of AI in our personal life. So, you know, figure out

what claude does. Figure out how you can add a skill to claude. Figure out, you know, what used to be called prompt engineering and why is it not relevant any longer. You know, see what open claw

is. How can you work to create a few autonomous agents that solve your personal life and so on. uh see if you can use whisper flow to uh use voice in your own personal life to write your you

know loveydovey messages to your spouse and you know so on right the point that I'm trying to make is that if you open your personal life to AI and if you allow yourself to be surprised to be

blown away by the power of AI most likely at least it's my bet most likely you will do the same in the companies that you're think &gt;&gt; I think uh

uh not advice but uh I think I would like to express few things. Um as decision makers stop thinking about treating voice solutions or AI as product features. Start thinking about

it as an infrastructure uh which compound with time. Um ask few technical questions to yourself. Can this solution be integrated with edge devices? Can we do code mixing? Can we

train our ASR models uh which are accent proced intelligent? Um I think start looking at matrix in a different way. Don't look at deflection points alone. look at those addressable markets which

we were not able to cater before the advent of void solutions and start believing the conversation between the organization and the customer is not a cost center. I think

the topic was uh u uh voice becoming a default interface for the next billion. In my view, the next billion is not waiting for better keyboards, better RAM, English lessons. Uh, in my view,

the next billion is actually waiting for a simple technology solutions which touch the the basic human capability which is voice and speech. So as a practitioner some of the uh you

know things we follow or you know as a user I think think of voice a as a very long-term channel and uh you know build everything around it so that you will be able to take a you know take it to a a

next level of efficiency in your whatever use cases you are able to you know implement it. Second is think of it as an end to-end solution. Don't do partial solutions,

right? Uh it might require a lot of back-end integrations but just you know giving a call to the customer and then ending it there doesn't work. You have to think end to end like for example if

I am buying goods on Amazon let's say 5,000 worth of goods through voice am I able to do a shopping stating that hey I'm I want to buy this goods for 5,000 rupees convert this 5,000 rupees as a

loan and into three AMIs of so and so amount now they're very complex task right one end you have a buying transaction second and you have a credit underwriting transaction whether I'll be

eligible for 5,000 loan or not third is you know I have a desire there to pay it in three installments, right? So it's but think of it can you do it end to end. So once you build up your journeys

like that the efficiency or the convenience which it will bring in which be far more superlative and that's where a lot of potential or I will a lot of you know harnessing uh in terms of the

new customer acquisitions or the experience part on the customer side we will will be you'll be able to take it to next level. &gt;&gt; Um thank you everyone. Um I think just

to sort of summarize the discussion right just calling out key things right so definitely voice is an interface that you can't escape be selective in terms of the use cases

that you pick up but build it out fully let it be a complete workflow embed these workflows not just in your professional but personal life and see the impact of AI once you start seeing

the impact the ROI will follow don't J's ROI from the beginning. I think ROI will happen as a byproduct if you just keep stay invested in this journey. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Nice to meet you. So in this session you will see uh perspective from different lens from civil se civil society perspective from private sector from think tank and then

from the government also. So before we start I would like to request the organizers to play a short video uh and after that we will delve deeper into the &gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, my name is James

founder and managing director of artificial intelligence international institute I as the co-organizer for today's session together with the German Indian uh business alliance. I'd like to

welcome all of you to today's special session. The topic for today's special session is called AI for humanity as sustainable development goal number 18. We're very grateful to the organizer,

the summit organizer for allowing us to host this. I regret that I can't be there myself personally due to unlimited unforeseen reason. But I'm glad to be given a chance to share a few words with

all of you. First of all, I'd like to share with you about the context of today's session. AI for humanity has always been the mission of artificial intelligent international institute AI

think tank that was formed in Singapore since we were formed in 2017. It's also a very important concept and idea proposed in the book that I co-authored uh core AI for humanity building

sustainable AI for the future with two other co-author Andma and Shukan and Shuko was actually present at the session today also to give the context uh the idea of

SDG8 for AI for humanity was proposed uh and shared uh at the United Nation department of economic and social affairs. back in 2024. Then it was proposed officially uh at the United

Nations University AI conference in Macau in October 2025. It's also uh actively promoted and advocated at Davos 2025 and 2026. Today we are very

grateful to be able to continue that dialogue and conversation with all of you at the AI impact summit in India. Second of all, I'd like to share why we are doing it. Unifying 8 billion people

under one voice towards the SDG goal number 18 is probably one of the simplest thing we could do to get collective wisdom uh to push towards AI for humanity. It is also to echo the

United Nations Secretary General Antonio's speech on September 2025 where he called for a future of AI with AI by humanity with humanity and for humanity. It's also very aligned with the United

Nation report published in September 2025 on governing AI for humanity. is also very aligned with the voices of the top scientists including professor Joffrey Hinton touring award and Nobel

prize winner as who has called for global collaboration to ensure safe AI as well as professor Yoshu Benju who has always been calling for safe AI for humanity.

I hope today's session will allow us to continue the conversation and bring global awareness at the same time garnered enough collective wisdom to have call for action towards that as

well. At the same time is very aligned with our AI's uh approach uh with the theory of change towards AI for humanity that we term make AI for humanity more profitable than AI.

Last in closing, I'd like to thank the organizer, the summit organizer, AI impact summit for allowing us to host the session. I'd like to express my gratitude to all our invited speaker,

uh, Samir Gallot, uh, Judy Wineberger, Sing, Maya Sherman, Shukan, and Vibra Amita for their participation and contribution. I also like to sh express my personal thank to

Samir for his extraordinary effort to organize the session especially in my absence. I hope all of you a successful and enjoyable session today at the same time work together to uh exercise

collective wisdom with the audience towards impactful outcome. Thank you very much. So before before we proceed further, the organizers have requested us to take a

group photo. So I think we should sit and then take a picture. Would that work? Yeah. Yeah. Proceeding further. Why we are doing this session? Currently

the population of India is 1.4 billion. The global population is more than 8 billion. More than 75% of the people are in the global south. And this is the first AI submit which is happening in

the global south. So the reason why we are doing this global south primarily known as uh developed majority or the country which are under development. So the reason they could be in the upfront

or in the race forward is through the optimum utilization of the technology and it's it's not a movement. It's it's a feeling which started not from us but from someone at the back end which also

have the same intention. So this movement was basically started uh way back in 2015 and continuously it has been propagated by the United Nation by international telecommunication union

that SDG18 is a necessity why the reason is almost 70% of so we have 17 SDGs but almost 70% are being achieved by digital transformation or the digital technologies but there is not a single

SDG which relates to uh the technology. So this calls for another SDG but uh which relates to AI for humanity and this is a perfect time when AI is uh impacting our every path of our life. So

before further ado I would like to invite uh maybe Judith for her opening remarks. Thank you very much Samir for having me here today and uh at the outset let me

please congratulate uh India on hosting this AI uh impact summit. I'm just coming from the MSC from Munich in in Germany and this was already very positively highlighted that India is

taking leadership. It's such an important topic um penetrating different kinds of um areas of our geopol geopolitical um relations. Uh and of course

congratulations to you Samir and thank you for the uh invitation to this very interesting um event here. Um I'm pleased to be speaking um on this very important topic today on behalf of

Hansidel Foundation India. We are a political foundation and think tank headquartered in Munich, Germany. Uh and we have operations in more than uh 50 countries.

Um here in India we look forward to celebrate our 30th anniversary in a couple of weeks and many of you might have heard the slogan especially now in recent times um given that the free

trade agreement was signed between the EU and India that the EU and India are natural partners and I think there are myates of reasons uh to substantiate this claim but one overarching uh reason

I believe is that the EU India partnership has never only been interest based it was has always been value based um as well and this holds true to the Indo-German cooperation um as well. In

light of this both Germany and India committed to the effective implementation of the STGS at Hansidal Foundation India through its projects and in collaboration with local

partners we strive to support this localization and implementation of STGS particularly SG 5, six and 13. It certainly is no news that digital means can effectively improve the global

effort of delivering towards the STGS and there are many concrete examples in this era of AI. However, a set of new questions arise that go beyond technicalities such as uh digitized

project management cycles or technology deployment for more effective resource um efficiency. We are increasingly looking at questions that revolve around a deeper

understanding of how AI can foster human development not at any cost but truly sustainably. So this is in fact what also drives us at Hansidel Foundation right now and I think this impact summit

is a wonderful opportunity to really um dive deeper and reflect and let me be frank while we at HSS India increasingly rely on digital tools to enhance our work for instance through digital

monitoring dashboards for the implementation of state climate action plans. We are still far from truly deploying what is often termed as AI for humanity.

And uh while there might be a lot of examples and probably many of you are aware of them that uh international organizations like international rescue committee already successfully use AI

for humanity. I do believe that the the mass or the broader spectrum of NOS's or those um multipliers who advance development sustainable development at a global scale they are not yet they have

not tapped into the potential of this but perhaps this is not entirely a weakness at this critical juncture of AI deployment caution may in fact be prudent while AI for humanity is widely

discussed and it trans and its transformative potential highlighted across global fora. We must first take a sober look at the risks that accompany it.

Probably you know being a German we also um always focus on the risk first before talking about solutions. So please allow me this perspective. So these risks need to be assessed against core pillars.

Ethical foundation, global harmonization, sustainability and the delicate balance between innovation and accountability. Only by fully understanding both sides

of this coin can we derive a robust actional road map, one that meaningfully advances the so-called SDG8 and can be implemented by a broad spectrum of organizations worldwide. When preparing

for the session, I also looked at the World Economic Forum's global um risk report 2026. And this report highlighted that um adverse AI outcomes rank highest uh among those most significant

long-term global threats. And those risks include the loss of human control over increasingly autonomous systems, the weaponization of AI, and geopolitical escalations.

In other words, if we are serious about AI serving humanity, we must be equally serious about addressing its governance gaps. Only then can AI become not a source of fragmentation and risk but a

genuine drive, a driver of inclusive and sustainable development. Therefore, humanity focused AI deployment is key to truly achieve social good.

uh in this regard I believe a robust regulatory framework is essential and I was already got a chance to have a little chat with u my co-panelist here on the regulatory side of things um and

the point I'd like to refer to without going into too much of detail is the EU AI act um which establishes the f the world's first comprehensive riskbased AI regulatory framework and it explicitly

is designed to safeguard human rights democratic values and sustainably sustainability in ways that align with STGS. Um the particularity about this act is

that it actually categorizes um AI systems from unacceptable risks. So we have sorry categorizes different degrees of risks and uh one is um unacceptable risks for example the

social scoring bands. Then we have high risks like mandatory um bias audits and hiring or lending tools and uh it directly mitigates harms like the discriminatory outcomes under SG10 and

promotes energy efficient AI practices to curb data center emissions supporting thereby SG13 and SG7 by 2026 full applicability um is uh aimed to but it sets a

precedent for AI as a force for collective good, countering dystopian risks like surveillance overreach while enabling STG aligned applications in health and poverty alleviation.

While this act is also being criticized in particularly by particular by industry for its um you know uh hampering characteristics in terms of overburdening um bureaucratic uh

implications and also NOS's have mentioned that there might be certain legal loopholes that diminish There also a lot of proponents who emphasize its voluntary nature as a

strength enabling early compliance harmonized standards across Europe and global leadership and trustworthy AI in the digital era frameworks like this India's AI impact summit and efforts

related to that as well as uh global initiatives such as the ITU's AI for good exemplify pathways forward mitigating risks like bias and disinformation while harnessing AI for

equitable outcomes as evidenced in some concrete examples including the IRC's um crisis tools. Um I was asked to also think of a quote that kind of fits to the topic of this

and I've chosen one from the from this year's international AI safety report. um and I quote, "AI's potential to serve humanity hinges on governance that prioritizes human flourishing over

unchecked power." So with all of this in mind and that's the second ask that was uh conveyed to me to come up with a concrete road map towards AI and humanity from my point of view. Um I

propose three components and I wouldn't call it a comprehensive road map. I suppose there are many more um pieces uh or bits and pieces to be you know referred to or integrated

um but as I understand um there are some that that can be highlighted here and one is referring back to my initial statement that the EU and India are natural partners there's

so much scope to further deepen the cooperation also in this regard uh so the the first um step that I am proposing is to adopt a hybrid regul population that kind of feeds from the

EU framework that I've just talked about and also integrates essential outcomes from summits like these. A second point or component is to invest in ethical pilots. We do not have to reinvent the

wheel when it comes to sustainable development or best practices in AI for humanity. We just have to look to countries in Africa who have successfully worked with certain tools

uh policies and frameworks. Um and that of course should be um underpinned by by by by different kinds of financing mechanisms and also public private partnerships in integrating the private

sector or having this kind of symbiosis between the public and private sector is essential in my point of view otherwise um the development in this regard might just spiral away from the actual ground

realities and the last point I'd like to mention here towards a road map is to foster global coal itions. Um, one could refer to the um, AI for Peace Africa summit as a reference point and and

further launch regular AI for peace forums that would be definitely needed to further advance the discussions and the expertise and have also experts that reflect both global the global north and

south. So with this, I'd like to close here and thank you once again for having me. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Maya. So uh &gt;&gt; sorry thank you. Thank you Judith. So

considering the uh areas which Judith has highlighted how EU AI act and the other peace areas could could assist in in in uh propagating AI for humanity. So that is something which is very pivotal

at the at the moment when the geopolitics tensions are on rise and these issues will be dictated by the technology going forward. So this is something which which comes at at a

perfect time and if if you see how the wars are being fought how the data is being theft. So these are the issues which we could definitely consider under this uh pivotal topic. Now moving

forward I would want to invite Viphov to highlight his areas of expertise and and to suggest some of uh the uh the the the uh concrete actionable wherein he he see AI for humanity could be a perfect fit.

Thank you. Thank you so much Samir and thank you Judith for that note and it's an honor and pleasure to be with all of you here. I want to split this into two parts. One is to answer a question and

kind of step back when we speak on AI for humanity. I think it's extremely important for us to understand that when we're talking about AI for humanity, the first fundamental thing so so that

we layer down and we become more concrete is that who are we talking about when we talk about AI for humanity. Right? So the first point there is of course the geopolitical

point has come out but when we talk about AI for humanity it's extremely important to know who our audience is and our audience is a combination of both global south and the global north

right and it it's slightly more nuanced than that to make it concrete when you're building AI for humanity for advancing that point it's important for each country each player in this

ecosystem and I mean international player in the ecosystem to be well aware of the fact where they fit in, right? Are they is a country a developer? Are they building foundation models? Because

we're talking about a very this this topic is all about the global sort of picture, right? Is the country a developer? Is the country using a built AI tool or is the country in the

application layer where they're fine-tuning some existing model and building applications on top of it. Second is to build AI for humanity is the

aspect of what feature matters to each country right when we build it for humanity right so it'll be about is is data sets more important for you is infrastructure more important for you

which particular AI type is important for you and what I've done is is we're talking about AI type we've spoken about the AI actor so make so to carry on from what Judith said how do with Does this

become concrete to build AI for humanity or for it to become a sustainable development goal to be driven by impact what I need is alignment on features and I would like

everyone here to think in this room what we're all humans in this room what is our expectation from AI what are the features I want in AI systems and if we think in from that perspective

We would realize that we agree more than we disagree at the broadest level. What it what it would be? It would be privacy. It would be security. You would want accountability.

You would want transparency which could tie to audits. You would want protection, you know, and you would probably want to uh safety, right? So the way to implement this. So when we

have to we have to shift our focus on these features and then to concretely implement this we have to to implement these features we have to think of what is known as the from my perspective when

we were having this conversation with Judith earlier is the law plus approach right law plus approach has also sort of come out in the paper published by the office of the principal scientific

advisor of the government of India as well uh that a paper that they published on technolal governance in January What is law plus approach? How do I build as as from a global lens? I

identify features which you would find these features almost everyone at the highest level agrees upon. Then we identify which laws help us enable that feature. Privacy can come in from data

protection law but privacy can also come in from the security lens from laws and from standards or from cyber security. Safety could come in from what advanced models are trying to build, but safety

could also just be trying to eliminate bias. I'm doing the very broadest implementation. So you have standards, you have laws, you can have industry frameworks. And so it's it's a it's an

alignment on what we're expecting for humanity. And once we have that alignment, it's about using multiple skills in the room. And the heart of what I'm saying which came out in

Judith's conversation is governance. Because as the final point AI for humanity lies on three pillars where the technology is going, how are we commercializing that

technology and where does governance which is risk mitigation of AI systems intersect with the first two pillars. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Vib commenting on that part. Currently in our

parliamentary system we have three main pillars. One is uh the parliament, the other one is executive and the the the last one is legislature and the fourth pillar which is very important pillar is

media. So considering that in the AI for humanity space these are the the three pillars remains the same but the fourth pillar which is media will be replaced by AI because everything currently is

being governed by AI and as web rightly mentioned we need to think about which area require the most require the uh humanization of the AI. Currently we are talking about the democratization of

technology but at the same time we should also think about humanizing of technologies. Reason being when we will when maybe after 5 years down the line when when we will have the

democratization of the technologies at that time we will think about the humanization of the technologies. So at that time it would be very late and most of the damages would be done by the

technologies rather than helping uh the humans to move forward. So building on that I would now like to invite Maya for her uh interference or the comments on this issue.

&gt;&gt; So first of all hello everyone uh and again thank you for for this opportunity. It's been a long time coordinating and brainstorming the session. So thank you Sam for all the

work and again wonderful to be here with the co-panelists. I think uh it's it's it's great to have different angles across the country. You know, we have here Singapore, Germany, India, and

Israel. And I think that actually all of these countries are bringing a slight different angle to how how we're seeing humanity going forward and the role of each countries in in the air ecosystem.

And again, brilliant interventions by by both of you. So I'll say briefly that I I'm definitely in alignment on on the role of governance in this discussion. Clearly I mean we are speaking about AI

for sustainable development but we should definitely speak about the way that we are governing AI in the public space. Um I I'm personally thinking that we should speak a bit more about core

governance how we're enabling more communities different ecosystem to be part of this discussion because in many ways if we saw in the beginning high level standards broader AI guidance

supposed to be for everyone we are seeing the gaps and voids today um we're seeing perhaps the loopholes of what in the beginning we thought could be broader AI guidelines for the atist for

the ecosystem systems speaking very highly of biases, transparency and accountability. But now when it comes to practice, when we are trying to implement AI in those spaces when all of

a sudden we need to think of how AI can be a better enablement of the ecosystem of how we can use AI in in climate spaces in agreech in healthcare we need to be slightly more nuanced. So I think

that first of all I feel that the AI community is shifting a bit in its narrative. So if we spoke in the beginning on this highlevel terminology of uh bias mitigation,

transparency, accountability, we understand today that we cannot mitigate them fully. I'm almost thinking of it that um in the climate space we went through something similar. In the

beginning we thought okay we will be speaking about climate mitigation. It took us time to understand that we need to speak about climate adaptation. uh and it comes under the understanding

that there are some things that perhaps we cannot fully mitigate but I think that we need to first of all adapt enhance the resilience in the in the AI discussion I think it's an important

thing it's almost part of the governance I think that we are now trying in many ways I think different countries are first of all trying to see what are the interesting AI block that are being

formed the role of different countries um I I I'll give an example because it's kind of recent but pacilica is a wonderful example a US initiative we have different countries joining it a

counter to China uh deep sea coming giving an interesting US uh alternative to open-source AI models and more to come but in the end and and perhaps as as an addition to the wonderful

interventions before we are trying to see how we can provide a better infrastructure for AI development understanding that the safeguards today so we we are aware of what are the high

level standards but we're trying to go a bit more to the nuances and perhaps a bit more to what sovereign AI models are supposed to look like. India is a wonderful example in this regard. Um

especially with the foundational models coming up the the work that Tomai has been doing in the country and and I feel that more countries are reaching this discussion but governance has to be part

of the discussion around sustainable development and I think that more interestingly it's about again core governance and countries trying to design some of these elements together.

So that's from my beginning but again we're still continuing. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Maya for your comments. Now I would like to invite Judith once again. Judith any area

wherein you think AI for humanity could be a benchmark or the practices wherein Hansettle foundation is currently working any any case study wherein you are currently utilizing this concept but

it's not there on the papers. Yeah, thank you for that question. Um, so I mentioned briefly in my introduction that our foundation um, which is headquartered in Germany, we

have presence uh, presences in 50 countries with over 80 projects. Um, and I'm of course uh, only in charge of India. So I'm not fully aware of um of all the projects that we do in in in in

relevant countries that could already kind of work with such um approaches or in in in that kind of a framework. But I'm sure um that I'm not mistaken by stating that we are just at the

beginning of fully embracing the possibilities of AI in the kind of work we do globally. And when I say we, I don't even I don't even refer to only us as Hansidel Foundation, but probably

many more um actors who have um who are active in in international cooperation and particularly in development cooperation. Um but like always, I think the private

sector is leading the way and then uh the public sector and publicly funded bodies and institutions are kind of following. I believe that that's going to be the the same dynamic here and

that's already evident as I mentioned that um of course certain kinds of tools and um advanced methods um that contribute to more effective crisis management by for example having early

warning systems um that can be integrated in in international um organizations that's already on the rise like the International Rescue Committee for example they have um successfully

using that. Um also WH in terms of uh one mal mal nutrition um predictive prediction tool. I think they use that in in Kenya. Um and and there probably many more

examples. Um but as I as I stated, I think we still have to first look into those kind of implications. Um what are the options right now? Where do we want to go? and where can we really um

further improve our own um projects and for speaking of India or our cooperation here with many local partners in the NGO sector. I think uh the opportunity here is to make processes simply more

efficient um more scalable um and to to a degree also more transparent and um I think that's a a kind of exercise that has just started and we are keen to explore.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Judith. Now coming back on Maya. Maya considering the innovation side or the areas wherein you are currently working what do you think how far we have reached and uh the the

picture or the milestone which we have set which which we have set for us where are we currently on this agenda on AF for humanity like it's such an interesting question

because on the one hand I want to say that again perhaps on a more optimistic note the fact and You know you're seeing it in the impact summit. This is again the biggest AI convention across all the

ones who are preceding and I do also do want to mention the most diverse one and and again you know as someone who as an AI researcher who moved to India especially for this reason because I

know that again um social technologies are part of this country and diversity by design is key in this country and I think that you know it's a big honor for India to see the level of diversity that

this summit is bringing it was lacking in previous uh editions also within the global north it was me missing but I think you know the tremendous role of India in connecting the global north and

south is something that takes the AI community forward so I'm saying this on the better side I feel that what we're still missing is first of all us as as AI scholars practitioners all across I

think that we are still missing the understanding of how we would like to see hybrid humanity going forward And I'm saying this because um there are some threat that we are not addressing

properly. One of them um comes to uh I think the intellectual parts. Um AI does make us uh I would say perhaps slightly lazier or in many ways we are becoming more dependent on the automation and the

machine and the human mind is becoming slightly rotten and that's something that we do not want to to get into. I'm saying this because we don't want to reach into a possibility that AI will

potentially replace us as humans and that's something that we're not addressing properly. The fact that human thinking is becoming slightly less complicated today because

we are reliant on the machine. I also want to mention that currently we don't have enough safeguards on genai models. We are seeing this with chatbot that are actually advising uh young users to

commit suicide. We are seeing this with different medical interpretations, different extortions that we are seeing on the platforms. We are in many ways have not put enough safeguards and

protection on on these platforms because they're somewhere in between. They've become our psychologist, the free psychology that we've always dreamt to have. This has a strong linkages in my

view to the way to want to see humanity going forward. It doesn't mean that we are doomed. It means that we are enjoying this AI hype all around us. We're investing so many budgets, assets

and still we have an important mission going forward which is to understand what role do we have in this ecosystem. Do we want to be um smarter using it? Do we want to let the machine doing most of

the work for us? There are so many interesting dystopian quotes of Bill Gates who unfortunately will not be arriving to the summit but I mean he would he was one of the only

ones from the AI ecosystem who will not be coming to India but he was saying that most of the most of jobs will be replaced by AI. In the same time Alon Musk is saying that uh money will no

longer mean anything in the next few decades because we won't need it anymore. People perhaps will not need to work. So I think that understanding how humanity is supposed

to look like that's our next mission. But I feel that the entire ecosystem is all here to discuss about it. But we need to move from discussions and declarations into actual concrete I

guess milestones for us to see on how this vision is supposed to look like from my perspective. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Maya for sharing that interesting perspective and I'm

looking forward when I don't have to work and then I can sit and enjoy my life. Now coming on vib considering the governance perspective uh the multiple committees that you are

part of how how do you think this initiative aligns with your areas of interest and what are the core sectors which could definitely be merged into this area.

&gt;&gt; Thank you uh Samir. Uh first of all I think uh very interesting interventions both from Maya and Judith and I and I want to kind of before I respond to that question I want to throw out a

fundamental question for the audience here when we're thinking of AI for humanity rather when we're thinking about AI. One thing that we must always keep in mind which is actually there

which is tied to the ethics discourse and responsible discourse is that when AI advances it necessarily asks us a question what is it to be human

and I think we need to keep that in mind right because when we're talking about AI for humanity and we're going to have AI AI is a pattern recognition tool it trains on data detects patterns from

data today it can generate text tomorrow it can generate code, it can generate images. Right? So I think one of the fundamental pillars of what will be AI for humanity would be for each one of us

to contemplate and think what is it that makes us human and if if AI is achieving a particular objective and achieving a particular task once it is doing that does that make us

less of a human? This is a slightly sort of philosophical theoretical direction but I think is an important point. Second in terms of the governance piece and where all of this intersects I think

all of the AI for humanity approach is pretty much aligned to the work that we're doing in the governance space and I'd actually four five points that sort of important to highlight when we think

about AI for humanity or protecting humans. Let's favor it that way. We're thinking of accountability. The two pillars of accountability that we need to understand. One very traditional way

that we understand is harm has taken place. We use laws and we take action. But that's not how governance works. Governance like I mentioned is law plus which means that we're building AI for

humanity. We have to become I be comfortable with the idea of mitigating risks mitigating risks across the AI life cycle. What do I mean by AI life cycle? It means when I'm conceiving

building an AI system, when I'm collecting preparing the data set, when I'm collecting the data set, when I'm building the AI model, when I've put out the AI model in the market and I'm

getting input on how the AI model is performing so you have to think of risks across the AI life cycle. Two, when we're thinking of AI for humanity, sure we have a developer, we have a deployer

who's using an AI model, we have end consumers. What we also need to think about and is an extremely important topic in the context of the summit also and perhaps in the presummit perspective

as well is what do we do about impacted consu impacted users and communities. We need what is now phrased as participatory approach to AI governance that has to develop. What does that mean

in simple terms? It means that if I'm building an AI tool which will impact which will which will contribute to a certain under reppresented population or uses data sets of a particular

population that is not so well it's taking effort to get them in the AI process my design processes have to have a way where I can take feedback at my development stage. Uh and the final

point two points one is that I also have to think of audits. Audits is a way of uh there's both product audits and process audits but it's about sort of keeping a trail. It's very simply put

maintaining a trail of how you have built the AI system or deployed the AI system or use the AI system which is trail and to keep it sustainable it'll go back to knowing who we are as a

country in the global ecosystem. what matters to us democratizing access to infrastructure building sectoral applications and what impact will that have on the

population that I'm building and increasing AI adoption for. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Vib. Now quickly uh I will give 10 seconds to each of the panelist. What do you think when you

heard this term AI for humanity comes to your mind? Starting from Maya, &gt;&gt; I would say um AI uh for inclusion, I think that we up until now the AI community was very gated.

This summit is the proof that AI can be more diverse. It should be and we are currently I mean think for years we've been missing the voices of of all countries in shaping regulation

legislation. If you want to have a proper society that is AI uhdriven advanced everyone should have a place in the table. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Maya. Now Judith

&gt;&gt; uh when think &gt;&gt; yeah when thinking of AF for humanity I think one word comes to mind especially also after hearing the contributions from my co-panelists um resilience. I

think if we successfully leverage the opportunities uh and possibilities of AI for that very cause for social good globally then we can build uh the a quality of resilience

that would actually sustain or kind of help us navigate through lots of crisis or prevent them even um so that's my question &gt;&gt; thank you thank you Maya Vehav

&gt;&gt; I think on the same same part same part on the as what Judith said different part of the coin when I think of AI for humanity of course I'm thinking of AI being an enabler but most definitely in

my mind it's it is risk mitigation it's about being aware of the fact on how do you mitigate the risks while you keep moving forward I mean that that definitely it's that constantly striking

that balance which is in tandem with how AI is evolving &gt;&gt; uh now before uh we analyze the key takeaways. If anyone in the audience have any questions, I would like to

invite them. Yeah, &gt;&gt; please please uh state your name and with whom you would want to ask the &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Hello, my name is Patrile and I'm a social policy um

professional and a columnist. been in the profession for about more than 35 years and it's really glad that I actually came to Sishma Swarajan and attend been attending since two o'clock

and the note of this ethics and inclusion which is what I've been writing on all my life and uh I feel ethics is not an add-on it has to be there right from the beginning and I'm

somebody who've been actually using AI and one of the things I would have liked a little bit more discussion on you know when you talk about ground reality and global south and inclusion is

hallucinations you know I've been going to a lot of the discussions just over here and I use AI and I feel if you are at a certain level of knowledge and then you use AI that's

one thing but if you wade into AI without any subject knowledge you are you're not going to be able to detect because they're very plausible plausible lies you know when you in my research

when I come up something and they will say this particular paper supports your thesis and this paper doesn't exist the writers don't exist now I'm saying thinking in a country like India where

you know one of the sessions I was attending where they talked about the number of people who are unlettered and this is something you know glitzy and blingy and tech I think it's extremely

important the accountability the governance to have this and while we must use AI and we must innovate we have to be realistic about it and uh you know if we don't do that if trust and the

ethics are not there right from the beginning. It's not an add-on. It's not something which you know you would cook the whole thing and then you toss it in as an afterthought. I think we'll be in

problems especially in a country like India and we have fakes so many fakes in you know in AI voice cloning all that people don't realize you know they they because it's tech they take it for you

know it has to be correct. So I think when you talk about AI for humanity, trust has to be I think a a major word and and thank you so much for an excellent discussion. Enjoyed it.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you for your suggestion. Anyone would like to comment in like 30 seconds. &gt;&gt; I'll be brief. Um tech literacy is key and it's part from any discussion that

we do have. I think it's above governance. Um in many cases the threat of deep fake also connected to the fact that we have a smartphone. So sometimes actually this this problem that we're

seeing of deep fake uh of lack of trust are actually across those who are who have this accessibility to mobiles and smartphones. And it's again we're speaking on digital divide is almost

paradoxical the ones that are um more connected are prone to these threats. Nonetheless uh especially when speaking on trust we need to be able to understand technology. So I believe the

tech literacy again something that India has been working constantly on 11 other countries. this is key across all ages. Um so I think that's the way to go forward clearly

&gt;&gt; and just to quickly add um literacy completely agree you have multiple approaches already in India suggested that there are frameworks for employing rep responsible AI suggested frameworks

for doing responsible AI across the AI life cycle. You have standards both from BIS and the telecommunication engineering center which speak about risk mitigation. You have current laws.

We've had a spate of personality right cases in courts. So there is work happening exactly on this thinking but this is going to be a permanent tension when you think of AI for humanity where

we're thinking of risk mitigation at the design stage and addressing harm when it has already happened. So we'll always be on both sides of the coin. I think we can take the questions uh

afterwards uh because the organizers are already mentioning we are uh we we don't have the time. So concluding this session I believe there are certain key takeaways or the key words which we need

to focus on while thinking about AI for humanity. Some of them are trust, resilience, inclusion and mitigation. With that, I think this is this is a topic which needs a complete one-day

capacity building program and we are working on developing a guide book as a concrete uh actionable framework. So probably uh you will see some more development in this space and we will

definitely have a discussion uh after this session on any questions which any of the participants or uh anyone from the audience would have. Thank you. Thank you very much. And with that I

would like to thank the organizers uh Alei Gibba German India Business Alliance Maya Judith and Viphav as well as shock shock. So sorry she was unable to attend because she had another

session at Bhat Mandepam and coming from Bhat Mandepam to here is is a chaotic and mess. So thank you. Thank you very much for staying and uh let's have a discussion after this. Thank you.

partner triple IIT Alahabad and Sparkex on AI for all building India's future ready human capital from school to workforce I request Mr. Prakash scientist E from CADC to escort our

distinguished guest on the stage. Today we have Professor Anil Sastraudes he will be available online. Professor Mul Sutane director IIIT triple IIT Mr. Vive Professor Om Prakash

Miss Neha and the entire panel will be moderated by Dr. I request for one group photo. Now I hand over the stage to Dr. Manda.

Hello. Okay. Good evening to distinguished panelist and esteemed participants. I Dr. Manda Kart, register of triple it Alabad. welcome you all to the panel

discussion on AI for all building India's future ready human capital from schools to workforce okay it is my privilege today to moderate the session now in this session we particularly

bring in policy architects institutional leaders curriculum designers industry representatives to deliberate an action on AI education at a scale uh which will cater to the requirements

of 2030 and 2040. Okay. Uh can we have slides? Okay. So there are key challenges and these key challenges let's understand through

some certain statistics and numbers what we have. So there are six 650 million uh Indians under age of 25 and about 170 million in the age of 18 to 25 who would be our workforce by 2030. Okay, that's

first one. Second, there are 260 million that is 26 cr students in K12 education. So they would be ideal workforce by 2035 or 2040 for the nation. As per World Economic Forum, 27% of global workforce

by 2030 would be supplied by India. Now the question is with this AI coming in so speedily will as a nation we are ready for it that's the question we need to answer

further there's a AI disruption that we are seeing for last 2 three years uh the Mackenzie report states that by 2030% of work hours would be automated so that's the challenge also the world

economic forum says that 85 million jobs that are today present will be vanished but at the same time there will be 97 million jobs that would be newly created with newly defined job roles. NASCOM

report says that by 2030 1 million AI professionals are required for Indian industry and current output is around 50,000 engineers annually. So we are producing just 5% of what is estimated

requirement of 2030. So that's again a key challenge. Now obviously there are certain gaps been observed and these are the preparation graphs that is under 5% of schools only teach AI education and

school education is a feeder pipeline to higher education and industry and innovation then the employability is a challenge uh whether it is engineering education uh 23% of the rate of

employability is observed as per NASCOM reports and as far as teacher capability human capability is concerned In K12 education only 2% of teachers are generally aware and trained about AI

education. So that's the challenge that we'll have. Uh if you look at the soioeconomic equity status then uh only 66% of urban India has internet access as well as 31%

uh in the rural part. So even the internet penetration is still at a lower side. uh if you look at ash report which is basically in higher education report the gender based is that women are 33%

of women are in STEM education and uh then and 22% in AI education so even that number is too low the scale at which the 2030 or 2035 expects us if you look from soioeconomic balances then the

families which are in top 20% income these families or children in those families have better access to the resources compared to rest of the children. So that's the challenge. But

though there are a lot of challenges, we have different opportunities. First is national education policy 2020 which says that we can introduce coding or AI education uh into the schools or K12

education. So that's the opportunity. We have adult tinkering labs already established in more than 10,000 schools which can be an enhancement to AI education which can be

modified to this and most important is that if you look at publications that come in from various different higher education then India ranks third globally as per Stanford report. So

these are good opportunities as a nation for us. So what we look at so we can say that we can cater to or target 10% of 26 cr or 260 million students studying in K12 education. So which is around 26

million or 2.6 cr students and if this 2.6 cr or 26 million students if we at conservative workforce conversion of 10% we can be at uh 26 million uh 2.6 million AI literate professionals. So

that is only 2x of the 1 million requirement. So by 2030. So what are the stakes that we all need to deal is there are around 1.5 million schools and that is a scale at which we need to penetrate

AI education. So that's the challenge. Second is we want to bridge soioeconomic gaps like urban rural gender as well as the income levels. Third is AI should augment education and

not as a replacement of the teacher or human capital. And fourth basic challenge is aligning caterial education, higher education and industry and innovation together. Okay. So with

this tone setting, let me welcome and introduce our panelist. And to address these questions, we have I'll introduce the panelists first. We have professor Anil Sersu uh who is chairman of NF

National Education Technology Forum but due to some 11th hour emergency he's not present here but he has sent a pre-recorded message about his opinion on the topic of discussion. Uh so he

will address basically policy architecture needed to mainstream AI education. Uh we have professor Mulles Sutani director of triple IT Alabad. uh he brings the perspective of premier

technical educations uh as development hubs and demonstration labs for K12 AI education. We have professor Om Takash director triple it Na Raipur. Uh professor Vas will share insights on

regional equity uh and how emerging institutions especially in developing states can anchor AI education in the regional areas. Then uh we have Miss Nia Sharma who is partner people advisory

services at EVA India. Uh so she brings industry lens that is how workforce requirements employability expectations and public private collaboration models can be established for better

penetration of a education. And we have Mr. Versni, founder of Speedlabs India and architect of SparkX uh competition or uh event that we had held earlier. Okay. So before we engage in

the panel discussion, I request Mr. VNI to introduce this park initiative. The floor is open for you. It was a very nice nice experience to give this exam.

&gt;&gt; This exam gave me a great experience. This device is very extremely helpful to this student and today I got to move WordPress and And here from the user

This is what I thought. The second is the main challenge in doing all physical AI. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh good evening everyone. Sparkex

was the event which we conceptualized to bring the ideas at a school level in tier two tier three towns specifically where the where there's a you know lot of demand lot of urge to learn new

things and uh we designed this entire competition in two parts one was an Olympiad which was a written competition about the learning and uh you know the knowledge about AI and the second was

giving the opportunity to students to come up with uh solutions uh using AI and solving some of the innovative problem statements that they could have thought

in their local ecosystem and we were surprised that the students coming from small towns coming to final event at IIT Bombay they come up with ideas ranging uh industries between education uh

healthcare defense uh logistics everywhere you know the young students between grade 8 9th 10th were coming up with ideas which which could have been executed at a professional level. So you

know we this was our endeavor to take this event across India and uh with the successful execution last year we are looking forward to reach a million plus students in the coming edition in 2026

and I think uh we are very thankful to triple IT Alawad for helping us in this entire conceptualization and looking forward to have a much bigger scale next year. Thank you Vive for your

introductory remarks. Uh we have I will now open the panel discussion and we have first question to uh professor Anil Sasu who is not here but he has sent a pre-recorded message. Uh may I request

to play the pre-recorded message &gt;&gt; question can &gt;&gt; namaskar good evening everyone Dr. So sut I'm very delighted that I'm here in an online mode

to talk about various issues related with AI and the question which was asked to me as a panelist about when should AI education start

from the class 3 or much later. This is a question which is debated all over the world but in my candid opinion earlier the better. So children at the age of about

8 n when they are in the class three this is the right occasion to create awareness to make them ease with the use of AI tools

understand the minor nuances and therefore it is apt and appropriate to start AI education in the class three onwards itself. Of course, the next part of the question is

should AI be different at different appropriate age levels? Yes, certainly yes. What children at 9 10 years can understand is different from what they understand at the age of 16 and

therefore what we teach after class 3 and what we teach at 8th standard and 10th standard must be age appropriate based on their development. in terms of all other courses and subjects that they

are undertaking. The next part of the question which you also asked was is AI education to be specifically as AI education or it should be across the

board in all subjects. I'm sure uh in the beginning naturally AI as a different subject may be necessary because all the textbooks all the teachers are not geared up for that

and therefore there are specialist maybe AI teachers who will start teaching from the class 3 onwards till class 10 as a separate subject but as we go along maybe in couple of years time

we must integrate it with all other subjects be it mathematics be it social studies may be it geography be it uh physics chemistry biology in fact AI has as an agnostic or

non-aggnagnostic you know it has to be part of every course every subject and therefore how in different courses different subjects AI is to be integrated has to be taken

care of by our experts who for writing textbooks, for conducting the teacher training programs, create that awareness and then we need not have a separate subject of AI but AI will become part of

everyday life. In fact, it will become a important life skill like we all of us learn language, we learn mathematics, we learn science. So AI will become an integrated part of all of these courses

and that is the manner in which we need to move as we go forward. As far as the frameworks are concerned, naturally there are different levels of uh guard rails that are required because uh there

are been reported items of unethical use of AI. Therefore, ethical use of AI is one of those very important uh subject matters world over debated and therefore we must have our own framework where we

detail out where to use, when to use, how much to use. I think that is the framework which uh whether it is uh the education ministry, whether it is the ministry of IT, the national education

technology forum, we should come all together and decide on this frameworks. There are countries who are banning the use of mobile phones or use of AI tools. There are others who are prominently

using it left side right center and therefore there is somewhere in between what we call middle path where not permitting is not right but use the tools of AI for effective methodology of

learning. So therefore several pedagogical aspects in terms of how learning takes place. Different students learn in different ways, different styles, how AI can enable them. Thereby

true access, equity and quality are delivered at an affordable cost to all of us. And that is the spirit in which uh the AI has to be utilized. And that's why frameworks which are robust

frameworks which create access and equity need to be created and also the availability of these technologies tools to all the citizens of the country including in the remotest areas is the

part which the government has to play a very important role. As far as uh the other aspects of use of AI and misuse of AI are concerned, some legal boundaries have to be set up. All

people have to be made aware of nonmisuse of AI and if someone uses it in a wrong manner. How penal actions are there is also to be told to all the citizens so that misuse is avoided. I'm

sure in terms of uh research is concerned there have been many reported things where articles get uh withdrawn and therefore ethical use of AI in even research is important. Teacher training

is important. Parents training is also equally important. How much to allow students to use AI and other at home and how prepare students for what we call vixit bharat is also

equally important. I'm sure all of you will go by this methodology which is adopted by the government in terms of ethical use of AI. Thank you very much. Okay. So with this note I thank

professor Anil Sasp for his elaborate answer on the first question. Uh now the the education ecosystem is spread as higher education and K12 education that is school education. Uh today we have

among our panelist director of triple IT Alabad who will basically comment on role of premier institutions. My question to you sir what specific role should institutes of national importance

like IIT NIT and triple IT will play in this quait AI education ecosystem. Uh floor is open to &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Uh at the outset uh please accept my warm greetings of the evening

as a in my capacity as a co-host of this particular panel discussion along with our partners Vive is here. I also must thank uh the panelist who accepted our invitation to be part of this panel

discussion. Professor Sraud despite some family emergency difficulties he was generous enough to give us the message on video and giving the responses. Name who accepted an invitation he's from ENY

my colleague ex-colague professor Omraashas who happens to be now director of triple inur the whole team of sparkex initiative speedx and sim learn AI and Dr. Mandara

uh this all revered co-panelist and esteemed audience again welcome to all of you Mandar I must appreciate you for the comprehensive statistics which you presented in the tone setting

presentation slides the role of uh INI we are institute of national importance triple IT triple IT alabad is one of the first centrally funded triple IT established by ministry of education

government of India we are 100% centrally funded like an IIT But we are IIT in the domain of IT. We are Indian Institute of Information Technology and we offer those hot cake branches

information technology, computer science, electronics and communication. And believe me that we receive the genius of this India the country bat. Uh J means toppers come to me. J means

toppers come to me. If a student gets admission in IIT Kpur the neighboring IIT for mechanical engineering J advanced scorer he leaves that and he joins my IT program 100% placements more

than 100 200 placement because peak packages are touching crores of rupees every year average package is 40 lakhs all 100% employable so no issues no worries at all but as an INI uh which is

a dream destination of the genius of this country. Do I have some social responsibility? Yes, we coined a term institute social responsibility like CSR. We appeal we we appeal na ma'am

that there is a corporate social responsibility to support society. So ISR there is something like ISR we should also support society. When we happen to be dream destination of

students from the society from the country pan India then do we really owe something to this society? Answer is yes. Triple ID Alabad's doors were never closed for schoolgoing children. We have

Alabad happens to be Priyagar happens to be the religious capital of the north India near Vanasi. It's also educational capital of Uttar Pradesh. Okay. We have many schools, many good schools. When

any principal of any school approaches us for visit of their kids to triple Alabad campus, we welcome them with open arms. We have first year physics teachers and first year chemistry

teachers. They're part of Indian association of physics teachers, Indian association of chemistry teachers and we celebrate a day physics day on campus wherein we intentionally invite 500

students schoolgoing kids on campus from 8 to 12th standard class. Similarly for chemistry just to create awareness interest about these schoolgoing kids and really chase their dream for the

destination of triple alabad create interest about science in them. We know that our constitution says that next generation should be very curious, anxious and it should be carrying a

scientific temperament, attitude of asking scientific questions and inquiry. NEP also says that but deep rooted in Indian ethos. We try to really follow that kind of philosophy and when we say

that then when the school going in children kids are allowed to visit triple ITA campus anytime in the throughout the year and we have some planned activities and calendar for

them. Uh we also have something like this that we want to engage with the schoolgoing kids. My all teachers couple of them are sitting in the audience also they have very elegantly adopted AI in

the curriculum in their behavior ethically as professor Sasrabuya is rightly saying and then we teach AI we breathe AI day in day out all my teachers let mathematics teacher ma math

teacher knows how to apply AI in maths okay we don't prohibit use of AI we certainly prohibit unethical use of AI on campus we are one of the rare institution in the country to adopt AI I

use policy in the institute one of the rare institute in the country. We do that and then when we say that we have a social responsibility of really elevating the stature and the standard

of these kids schoolgoing kids so that they can reach the destination like triple IT or IIT or NIT then what we can do so we can create AI contained for schools unique example we collaborated

with Vivee and Pravin is here and what we could do the Dr. Surya Prakash is here my young faculty colleague is here. Professor Sunali is here with them they created the content for Olympiad which

we did for the country and then the culmination was in Techfest of IIT Bombay. So we three together came and we could really generate or create enthuse awareness in schoolgoing kids about AI

education that we could all do right and we are happy that we are really percolating disseminating the education the worm of AI education in schoolgoing kids and we are really discharging our

duties with the responsibility that we're doing. I think that is the role of INI like triple 80 alabat mandar that we should be doing this consistently persistently so as to create awareness

about education of good use of AI in schoolgoing kids and uh fortunately we have partners like Vive with us okay we could do that and the visual impact is seen v Olympia video and then we are

happy that we are doing this okay there are multiple ways in which can contribute But only thing is that because we don't know much about the cognitive levels of schoolgoing kids how

easily they'll assimilate grasp the knowledge of AI in them. We need some kind of mentoring from NCERT CBAC for that sake. Professor Bha could not make it today. He was to be our co-panelist.

He could not make it today. But NCERT, CBAC could should really frame a curriculum for schoolgoing kids. We are here to design the content to deliver the content to the best of our capacity

and that is also part of our ISR. Okay. Institute social responsibility. I think we should be happy about it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank Thank you sir for your commitment.

And now as as a nation we are spread into multiple regional diversity. Uh we have few states few cities few metros which are highly developed but we also have uh states where still education is

a challenge. So we have professor Om Praash Vas director of triple it inur. And my next question goes to him. How can new triple its state government colleges tier colleges in tier 2 and

tier three cities serve as regional anchors for penetration of AI education uh to these schools and skilling in schools? So please the floor is open to &gt;&gt; First greetings of the day to all the

people sitting here. It's really very interesting to take this uh issue of tier 2 tier three cities in the India. We have to realize that as per AICT more than thousand engineering institutions

are in the tier 2 and tier three ecosystem more than uh these people the important uh in in this case is that we have to understand how digital India arrived and how we want to progress to

AI India. Digital India was more uh towards the connectivity towards the uh making the people part of the whole ecosystem but AI India is a different ballgame altogether. AI we all know is

as good as the data on which it is trained the diversity on which it is particularly applied and then if you are willing to really make an AI relevant you have to understand that here now the

inclusivity is not a charity it's not a option it's a basically model design it's a Robert's decision that the tier 2 tier three uh ecosystem should be included and how to include it we can

definitely have the state engineering colleges and triple its like us who are close to the rural areas they can connect with them in terms of creating a cluster approach where we primarily help

them in the curriculum design in faculty uh capacity building and trying to create the local relevance to the AI models and as we all know the algorithmic bias in AI ethics in AI is

going to play very very important role in future so we have to keep creating a child safe environment in terms of AI development usage and continuous upgradation of data. We also know the

vernacural languages and the vertic particularly the difference in the cultural aspects of India. We have to very clearly understand that AI model which is trained encompassing all the

possibilities will definitely be much more relevant, much more usable and definitely much more successful. So a very strategical approach has to be adopted to include a tier 2 and tier

three institution in a a very structured approach to have AI inclusivity. Thank &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. Any education is not complete uh if we exclude industry. So we have two

industry partners here and uh there's a industry perspective because we talk about workforce readiness and industry also has expectations from the upcoming or incoming workforce. So my next

question goes to Miss Na Sharma. Uh she represents industry here. Uh my question is what specific AI related competencies beyond coding are you finding critical for employability of young aspirants or

young workforce? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you so much for having me here. It's really good to share the stage with such eminent group of panel members. So thanks once again for having

me here. uh I think u you know as from an industry standpoint when I look at uh employability at an entry level there are there's a massive shift that's happening and some some bit of this

reality is probably aware we are all aware about it so there are three broad shifts that I see in the industry at this point in time from an entry- level employability standpoint one of course

is that uh India you know is at a very very prime stage where uh you know we are expecting about 2.3 new uh AI 2.3 million new AI jobs to be created by 2027 and I think that is itself is a

phenomenal opportunity if you're a student in this country. Uh having said that uh you know it's it's also a fact that uh you know when I when we look at the last 12 odd months there has been uh

you know a a very sharp decline in terms of the entry level or traditional entry level openings as compared to corporates in India and this trend is probably going to increase uh you know over the

next few months given the fact that AIA is going to take over some of the routine task routine jobs that uh entry- levelvel uh you know graduates or or postgraduates really started their

careers with uh interestingly in addition to that uh you know we also see that if you look at the you know the latest uh skill India report of 2026 it also pegs uh you know graduate u you

know employability level at about 56% uh for this year it was 54% last year and now 56% so of course it's improving but at the same point in time if you know India produces roughly about you know 10

million graduates uh you know in a year we are saying 44% % of them are probably not employable and that those are stark numbers to really sort of look at but I still go back to the first point that I

you know made which was it's a very interesting time for us and it's a great opportunity if you're a student in India because there are some you know 2.3 million new net new AI jobs that are

going to be there the country needs it a lot of you know industry needs it and and there is great optimism around it and these are not just STEM and tech jobs that I'm talking about so if you're

non-coder it's it's an equal opportunity or probably it's a better opportunity for you to today be uh you know a student and be applying for some of these uh you know roles. So if if you

have to ask me clearly there are two most important critical skills that I'll tell every student uh you know to really really pursue at this this point in time. Number one is and I think I heard

some of my panel members also speak about it. We are not competing with AI and students should definitely not compete with AI. We are in a world where we have to embrace AI. It has to be a

part of everything we do. we have to leverage AI in terms of making productivity uh you know the next uh northstar. So it so my my one advice to all students is that as much as possible

it's in your curriculum or it's outside your curriculum you must start using dabbling with AI make your mistakes figure things out learn prompt engineering learn the language of AI

which is prompt uh even figure out a lot more around the AI integrated tools you know so so if you have to make a good presentation and and and that presentation requires data analysis and

data integration and visualization there could be three different tools available today in the market which can uplift your you know outcome to a next level. So use some of those and really really

be friendly with AI use AI in in a lot of uh you know your everyday orientation. So that's one and the second uh you know skill that is clearly needed by students as they enter

corporate is domain expertise and this domain expertise is uh you know domain could be anything around sector industry function technology but getting into depth of you know what problem are we

trying to solve is just extremely critical for you to be employable in today's day and age and I'll give another example over here like uh a year back if there was a you know sales

analyst who was taking an entry- level job in any of the uh you know Indian conglomerates or any of any M andC company across India you know you would be expected to create one of the

outcomes of your job would be to expect to create you know sales report uh which is essentially going to be like you extract a lot of data from the CRM you clean the data you analyze the data you

probably sprinkle a bit of you know insights on that and you you know share it with your boss or your management and and expect them to take a lot of decisions today and even if it's not

perfect it's going to get perfect over a period of time AI I can do all of this and do it really really well. So then what's the job left? The job that you now need to do is to really use that

domain intelligence of the context in which you work which could be your industry or you know why a product is not performing well or you know why is it that competition has launched

something so different. You know get all of that intelligence into the AI system for it to kind of produce more insightful actionable reports for you. So it is these are very interesting

times. there is great opportunity but at the same point in time I think speed is of essence here of how do we really make sure that our students that are graduating are truly employable in

today's day and age which is changing so fast just wanted to share those thoughts with &gt;&gt; uh thank you Niha further uh when we did spark x exercise

uh with speed labs and triple it alab together as a collaborative exercise uh we had lot of uh establishments of development labs and demonstration labs. So my question goes to Vive WNY who is

uh representing speed labs here is what are the minimum viable infrastructure requirements in terms of hardware, software, connectivity, teacher support to run such meaningful AI programs in

schools across different resource contexts. Uh hello hello as the other uh co-panelists have already highlighted the need of uh you know the the urgent

sense of urgency that is required in the nation towards AI education. I think the first question that comes to any school owner's mind is how much money to be invested to to be ready for that kind of

uh you know education in their school. I think um it is a matter of choice of how much you can do but obviously the first step is to recognize the need uh put up the basic infrastructure in the form of

computer lab as well as robotics labs because if we have to redesign the workflows of future the students need to have a hands-on uh learning experience hands-on uh you know discussions about

these problem statements which cannot be done in a pure uh booksdriven uh classroom environment. ment. Uh the second thing is that if we look at example of USA last year

almost 70 plus organization committed uh enough funds for the school education on the behest of the government of USA. I think that is the model which has to be explored. Government of India at some

point has to take that call that can we invite the funds from the industry from the in the form of CSR if the government funding is not sufficient and really support even the private schools in some

manner uh there could also be models in which the the IITs NIT triple IITs and other good colleges can share their infrastructure as well as faculty days and allocate them towards the gap of

school requirement. uh what I also want to sensitize here everyone is that the any uh gradual uh shift will not solve the problem at the problem that we are trying to solve if we think it is a

10-year problem probably we will you know fall behind we will not be able to solve it because by the time we will solve it the problem will be magnified multiffold uh it is very important that

um as a nation we move with a sense of urgency and try to solve it in a 2 to three years time frame and any incremental delta approach will not work here. You know it is quite evident that

AI has already beaten uh human in reading uh maths uh scientific reasoning. So it cannot be matched uh by everyone to build out things which AI can build. The only way we can still

remain employable as a as a students is that we learn how to use AI as a creator of technology rather than as a user of technology. And at some point that learning and that mindset has to be

taught in schools. Um my belief is that uh the best age to learn that is primary schools and middle school because uh in India unfortunately after 9th the pressure of marks comes. So you know uh

willingly or unwillingly students cannot devote lot of time to extracurricular learnings. But if we can very productively use the primary school years and the middle school years in a

way that teaches them how to solve problems using AI uh I think that will be the fundamental shift in the way of learning and I think it is a time for uh a total reset in school education

system. uh there should be many more conferences around it. There should be many more talks around it. I think the way AI impact summit is uh you know organized at a national level where

industry, academia, government and uh international bodies are coming together and ideulate. Uh similar way uh at a school level with a sense of urgency we must uh create a brainstorming sessions

ideations and try to drive a total reset in the school education uh sector. Thank thank you. Uh my quick next question to um professor mul sut. Uh a quick half minute comment. uh can we

have uh various programs where BTech, MTech or PhD students in higher education can serve as a AI education facilitators? &gt;&gt; Can such models be built in?

&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Why not? Why not that with the support from this corporates or I can say industry partners like uh Vive okay we could set up an example right? Suya is here and then we could have some

small lab which was set up by them. investment came from them and believe me that all my BX friends were also were very excited about this small facility which was set up by SparkX in triple A

robotics small kid kids k kids and then some kind of AI coding and programming and they could really make the robotics to run in life and experiments they were really designed for schoolgoing kids so

we have the brightest of all BT students then master students and PD student they can certainly work as volunteers we can develop demonstration studios and labs in the domain of AI and Let's say AI

applied to vision, AI applied to language, languages, AI applied to anything, robotics and so on. AI applied to healthcare for various domains. And as we said that we have best of the best

cream of the society kind of teachers and students and we can volunteer. We are committed to volunteer ourself for this uh social outreach program. We can certainly say that how do we in turn

reward that? We can say that my the my colleagues like professor Sonali or Dr. Surya Prakash they devote time in volunteering for school connect for AI education then it will add to their

appraisal certainly I'll also probably tangibly benefit them in terms of some kind of plus to their CPDA profession development all that I can do for the students who volunteer to take part in

this uh kind of activity I can we can give them a certificate okay appreciation or probably we can have say it's a social internship for them we can all lot some credits to them they can

earn credits out of this social internship which is a school connect program for AI education. We can do that. We also have I can say that I can endorse or probably recommend very

strongly such students who volunteer themselves for AI education connect to the corporates to my uh probable recruiters that these students have social inclination. They are best kind

of uh student who has some passion to do something for the society and what you need is not only the intellect, not only the brain, you also need the empathetic hearts. Okay. So see to it that you

select these students with the priority preferentially and benefit them in turn. So we can certainly demonstrate this model to the world and we are committed as we rightly said all my teachers all

my bright students all of them are committed for AI school connect program because we have that passion and we have that expertise. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Uh my next question to

professor Vas uh how can the regional institutes can act as a biirectional knowledge flow between higher education research and school level pedagogy? &gt;&gt; So quick comment please we are in short

of time. uh as you know this a very important role that tier 2 tier three places we can do that triple it is especially located in these areas can work in hub and spoke model and to help

the joining and engineering colleges school institutions in terms of curriculum design in terms of faculty capacity building and try to also incorporate the local uh knowledge local

systems into the AI because as we know it's not only just enabling them to learn AI but also they can contribute to the AI systems and the hub and spoke ball can definitely be created but it

requires the multi-dep departmental coordination multi-government uh facilitation to make this happen and of course this will be very very useful for the uh AI in terms of all inclusivity.

&gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Uh in uh in view of the time I'm a quick question to Miss Nha. uh what specific gaps are encountered by industry during hiring even from a premier institutions like instead of

national importance like IIITs, NITS etc and a further extension to this uh with a industry perspective at what level the education should be introduced into the schools and if industry would co-invest

in K12 education and higher education apart from the CSR charity what kind of efforts the industry would be like to take for workforce pipeline development. &gt;&gt; Sure. So I'll try and answer. There are

about three or four questions in that. So I think just to start with um we are in we are in a stage where uh industry and academia and policy necessarily have to come together a lot more faster or in

a lot more collaborative way. I think there's no doubt about that. Time is of essence. If we are not able to make significant she shifts in the next 12 to 18 months. I think I I agree with some

of my co-panel members. we are going to be seeing ourselves as lagging behind and therefore it is important that we move beyond a bit of this CSR philanthropic sort of a view around

contribution to truly come together and and make things work you know for the students and for the future of this country. So I just want to first you know reiterate on that aspect of it. Now

coming down to uh you know what challenges do we see from you know school students coming in from premier schools or premier B schools across uh not just EI but across all multiple uh

you know client organizations that I see. I think what what's great about the students that we get is uh you know their intellectual capacity to connect uh you know different dots and just to

share quality of mind. I think that's fantastic and that's that's something that is basically a quality of mind that can learn anything and I think that that's something which is great. I think

what one would expect a little bit more is probably initiative. We are in a you know day and age where um you know um very quickly the hierarchies across organizations are collapsing as I think

all of us would have been experiencing. So you know you could be a fresher from campus or 2 years of experience or you could be somebody with 12 years of experience very soon you'll start seeing

that they can be very much equated in the AI world right so just initiative coming in with smart brains is something that you know probably would be uh an added advantage to it and sorry I think

there was another question that you had asked but uh you know I'm also seeing times up over here &gt;&gt; so okay probably we'll pick that up uh offline then

&gt;&gt; yeah sure so uh may I request uh to play the second uh video of professor sra bud. I'll just read out the question to him. What governance structure would you recommend to ensure convergence among

multiple uh regulatory stakeholders and industry bodies? So &gt;&gt; as far as the question of convergence of various regulatory bodies like uh AICT, UGC, NCTTE, Ministry of Education is

concerned. The very fact that a new bill is coming into the parliament called Vixit Bharat Shiksha Distan where merger of all these regulatory bodies is going to take place will solve one part of the

problem. The second part is naturally when there are multiple agencies existing there must be discussion there must be debate and by mutual consent each one of the regulatory bodies must

adopt a robust framework for the ethical use of AI. As far national educational technology forum is concerned, it is not merely the use of technology such as AI but in terms of pedagogy how augmented

reality, virtual reality, metavor, digital twins, animation, simulation and what we call as ABGC sector. The use of all these technologies can be embedded for twin things. One is for

teacher training for that effective way of uh teaching learning process in a classroom where attention span of students is reducing is one part of the story. The other part is how students

can be engaged in the classroom by creating interesting exciting content and also enabling students to use their creativity. In fact, creativity is a human trait. However, AI tries to become

creative. The creativity of the homo sapiens will be still ultimate and therefore AI tools must be used for empowering students to become more creative and thereby we may have a lot

of competition amongst students to create more interesting inquisitive content for children below their age as well as above their age. also for teachers, also for parents and therefore

AI as a tool all variety of data sets which are fed to it based on the past and previous experiences make it an intelligent system but how it can become more intelligent and what it can do in

terms of creating a creative content is where human intelligence will come into play. I'm sure uh frameworks which are developed will be used by all the agencies in order to move forward. Thank

you very much. Thank you to all the panelists. Now the floor is open to the audience. We can have quick two or three questions from the audience.

Can you pass on the mic? &gt;&gt; Hello. uh basically I just want to add uh two points uh whatever the discussion. So one point I want to add as the uh directors have said that uh

definitely we will be the part of the social responsibility and by the way I want to just add that we already uh started the fulfill the responsibility of the social because in the uh Olympia

uh around 10,000 student already participated in that and we conducted the workshop uh and after that they submitted the project in the techfest. So this part already done by the triple

I ala with the collaboration of the standard. So this uh means this kind of social responsibility we already fulfilled mean we started and in future also we will uh completed and I also

want to add one more point with the bases uh that uh as s said that uh yeah okay school actually first uh understand what is the need of that but I want to tell you that okay the after the need uh

they can start like in the government school also they can start with the single computer because we already made the some videos the LMS with the uh STEM learn so they can get the uh lecture

from there and they can start with a single computer at least uh like in the government school and the private okay if they have the fund they can up to some extent because uh we have all kind

of uh like with the termin we have all kind of facilities okay thank you &gt;&gt; maybe the mic can be passed to the audience &gt;&gt; um my question to Miss Nha um you

mentioned about domain expertise and how it's critical in developing or designing AI Okay. Uh for people who have domain expertise uh what roles exist in AI if they want to contribute uh to AI uh you

know &gt;&gt; yeah I think it's an interesting question and I'm assuming you're talking a lot more about not just entry level but levels above in the organization

right now mid management to senior management and I think we spoke about employability that itself uh you know corporate India itself is going through a lot of change. So around domains and

if you have been say a functional expert in finance or in supply chain or in healthcare or uh even in services or banking this is again a great opportunity for you you know for to to

share some facts with you for every tech or STEM job there are 10 non- tech and STEM jobs in the market right now from an AI standpoint so that's the opportunity now what are these jobs

these jobs are a lot about you know can you have a better communication language with AI like prompt itself and prompt is an art and a scale like any language it's an art and a skill to it. So asking

the right questions to AI itself is uh you know very important which most people are not able to get it still even after a lot of training. The other role that is being really in demand is you

know around the AI tool integration which is again to say that you need to prod you have a business problem to solve and you know what what you need as a leader in the organization you from a

domain expertise standpoint you need what what uh you know what data you require but that data is not going to come from one AI tool. you need to look at five different AI tools, assimilate

the data, think about it in a different way and then produce it back. So just a knowledge of a host of AI tools that are available and which one is important for you to solve the problem itself is a

skill in its own way and those are again growing jobs in the industry right now. Another one is AI content optimizer. There's so much content and right content and bright content that AI is

generating right now which could be even synthetic content. But you know if you to make a marketing campaign can you really look at the right things that AI is producing and then be able to apply

yourself. So human judgment is at the top and the most important needed right now. But using AI and then elevating the outcome is the skill that all professionals need at this point in

time. &gt;&gt; We can we can have only one more in the interest of the time. &gt;&gt; Maybe. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh shall I?

&gt;&gt; Yeah please. &gt;&gt; Okay sir my question is with professor Vas and professor Sutam like we are working for AI reachability to the school level. So being a education

expert and in a leading role. I just want to understand do we think that we should improve our teachers training program uh like BAD or MMED or whatever uh TT courses which we are uh using for

our primary teachers for their preparedness because we are doing it in a outsource fashion but somehow we need to update our teachers skills so that we can actually get the AI into the school

level. &gt;&gt; Thank you. It's a really pertinent question that all the training whatever they have received so far it may not be so relevant as of now in the face of AI

uh revolution and we should definitely try to construct some AI refresher program AI orientation program especially the area of AI ethics will be very very crucial because you're dealing

with a child of very tender age so we have to definitely construct these programs and try to definitely correct between the schools and the institution like ours I completely agree with you.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you sir. Uh so in the interest of the time as we come to the end of the session first of all I thank you all the panelists uh for the reach and elaborate discussion. I thank
