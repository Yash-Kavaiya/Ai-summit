## 📝 Summary

India’s AI opportunity is global: products can be built locally and sold worldwide, but leadership depends on translating India’s strengths-talent, digital infrastructure, and cost-efficient execution-into scalable applications. This session spotlights where India can lead across the AI value chain, focusing on sectors like financial services and insurance, where AI transforms underwriting, claims, and risk. It will examine sovereign AI-autonomy in models, data, and compute-and how cross-domain investments can accelerate India’s advantage.
