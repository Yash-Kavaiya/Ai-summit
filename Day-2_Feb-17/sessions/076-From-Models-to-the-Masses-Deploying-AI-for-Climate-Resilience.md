## 📝 Transcript

and Bashri Tapa at CW from the sustainable food systems team to take the conversation forward. Thanks Kalika. Uh good afternoon everyone. Uh at the

council climate resilience is an important and a critical area of work for us. One of the in fact the biggest teams at the council works in climate resilience. We did a CVI climate

vulnerability index in 2021 which is the one of the most googled and quoted report. 2023 we did subdistrict level monsoon pattern uh across India and subsequently heat index in 2024. We are

in the process of working with 300 cities to create 300 action plants and host uh as well host the South Asia hub for the global heat network. uh doing all this so much of climate

data and working with so many of governments at the state and national level we realize there is a climate data is large isolated complicated and it comes from multiple sources. Data alone

is not the answer. It needs to be intersected with sectoral data layers to really draw the insights. And again we have lot of risk models lying in lot of GitHub repos uh research papers but they

are not available at the point of decision. That's where the com we imagined a single platform that can modular scalar integrate with multiple data sets and with a ease of

visualization downloading comparison etc. Climate data comparisons across horizontation, heat, temperature. Sectoral data sets around example infrastructure layers

like data centers, power, agriculture all come together to draw risk profiles for districts and all of this together come together in an API format friendly format which

is interoperable works with multiple systems coming together and working together. What you see on the screen is a short demo video of the product uh that are going to soon to be launched.

And we didn't stop there. We extended to become a conversational climate agent which works with authorized public data sets. You can find queries in natural language, extracts information and those

queries can be complex, relate multiple data sets together and you can get answers uh in forms of tables, charts, u uh okay you can see that on the screen

so I was talking to these charts, tables etc can be downloaded and utilized in reports presentations etc. Moving on, second use case that we explore with AI

and climate resilience is geospatial AI where we go from risk district level risk or sub district national level to exactly building level risk. That's where we use geospatial AI to have

neighborhood level risk zones and that's where actual decisions of adaptation infrastructure or highlighting risk zones actually take place. At the end of the session the people who are attending

session we would be displaying a QR codes and would be giving access for a preview of the product an early beta user. I hand over to Banri to speak on the work for AI for agriculture. Now

thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Um he mentioned that climate data is complex. Um well for agriculture sector which is dominated by small and marginal land holders. Uh agriculture

data is just as difficult to just a second. Um yeah to track, monitor, report and analyze at the farm level. Um over decades decision makers um have relied on

u course and aggregate uh district level datas derived from agricultural census um uh national surveys and crop cutting experiments uh to uh analyze and uh understand farm level insights. Um but

imagine if you could get insights on agricultural fields at the farm level at the plot level in real time and during each season. Innovations in field level visualization via Google's anthrokashi

tools uh amnex and other players in India are transforming the way in which we learn about agricultural decision- making in real time today. But why are these transitions important for India's

food systems? India's crop systems rely heavily on monoculture and uh three dominant crops rice, wheat, sugar cane consume over 7 45% of the total gross crop area um overly absorb and consume

India's annual fertilizer subsidy bill and rice buffer stocks are actually three times more than the required amount um leading to a wasteful use of resources. Crop diversification offers a

climate resilient and a growth aligned strategy for agriculture sector yet scales to fail because of uh challenges in policy delivery and implementation mechanisms. We reviewed state level

policies of diversification across India and we highlighted um the bottlenecks that scale that uh hinder crop diversification incentives through direct benefit transfers to scale across

uh farmers across states in Hana, Punjab and Orisa. we find two key bottlenecks. First is that incentive amounts are insufficient uh to truly motivate farmers to diversify away from rice. And

while that is a problem for economists and may be taken up in a different session, the challenge that we are trying to highlight here is the lack of trust not just with with the farmers but

also with policy makers. At the farmers level, the challenge remains around delayed payments for actual farmers who are transitioning away from rice, but also poor grievance redress when amounts

don't come to their uh payments or their bank accounts or they are left out of the schemes. For policy makers, impostor beneficiaries and fraudulent claims of crop shifts without actually shifting

derails and demotivates them to pursue direct incentivization for crop diversification. AI powered tools can unlock these underlying pain points for diversification and allow scaling of

diversification across India. Um due to the posity of time I will highlight only two use cases of um such uh use cases that are now being enabled through AI powered um technologies. Um with

Google's AMED agricultural tool as well as Amnix uh they are now able to identify crop growth at different stages in agricultural fields allowing payments to directly automatically uh get

transferred to farmers at during the cropping cycle without delays in payments and without verification delays uh at the ground level. Um for policy makers um land use classification tools

enabled by Google's ALU supports uh you know classification of land types within as agricultural land urban land or other lands allowing for identification of correct beneficiaries and allow

targeting of spee what we realize is that these tools can enable crop diversification policies which require behavioral change at the farm level and motivations at the farm

level to be targeted and allow for governments to use these insights to ensure that crop diversification schemes are targeted and scaled um in uh in a staged and smart manner. Um this was a

use case that we wanted to highlight u in agriculture in a sector which is fragmented and deals with uh data gaps and hopefully this will kind of enrich the discussion that our uh panelists

will later have with that I hand over to thank you everyone and welcome to our session again. We will be having a wonderful panel discussion moderated by Dr. Arunabagosh the CEO of the council

on energy environment and water. I will hand over to him to introduce the panelists and lead us into the conversation. &gt;&gt; Thank thank you Kunalika and thank you

uh Weber and Banish for [clears throat] the presentation. Good afternoon everyone. Uh welcome to this session hosted by Google and CW. Um we frontloaded the report launch so you can

understand why we wanted to focus a lot more on how do you deploy AI for resilience whether it's in agriculture or generally um AI and climate science are of course advancing uh at an

unprecedented pace but at the same time uh we fa we find that despite these technological advances the intelligence still fails to reach the decision makers or to the market enablers or to the

market participants in a way that delivers effective action at scale especially in the global south. This is why we've worked on this paper on AI and agriculture but as as web also

demonstrated the tool that we are developing and which will be launched publicly as a digital public good offering from CW as a climate resilience atlas. We're looking across agriculture,

water, urban systems, etc. to make sure that the insights are usable, trusted, and embedded within real planning and response systems. So in this session we explore how AI enabled climate

intelligence can move from models to the masses supporting preparedness and planning at a hyperlocal level whether it is a village a neighborhood a city a district or beyond. Uh by examining

these real world deployments as well as the governance needed for this, we hope to highlight the how science, data, policy, markets and action can come together to fill the last mile gap and

deliver climate resilience where it matters the most. Uh we've got a terrific panel. We've got uh we're just going to quickly introduce them and then I'm going to dive straight into the

questions and let them do the hard work. Uh Professor Manbendra Sahara, Professor uh Sahara leads the hydro sense lab at IIT Delhi and brings deep expertise in climate extremes, flood risk and

translating geospatial science into decision relevant frameworks. We also have uh Miss Ashley Thomas who leads climate and environment portfolios at Google deep mind impact accelerator

working to translate frontier AI research into real world climate action similar to what you just heard. Got uh Miss K uh uh Dr. Ram Prasad Manohar um chairman of the Bangalore water supply

and sewage board bringing the perspective of frontline governance at an urban level. uh dealing with growing climate stress and we have Miss K. McGowan uh who's senior director for

policy at digital at the digital impact alliance bringing in a global lens on governance equity and digital public infrastructure for public good in particular climate data. So let me dive

straight in. Professor Sara um from your experience and from what you all saw which are the areas in terms of real world impact where you think climate models and AIdriven research can move

from pilots to proofs of concept and beyond. And uh in that way could you also tell us a little bit about what you do with Hydra? &gt;&gt; Sure. Um thank you every thank you and

welcome everyone to the uh session. Everyone is very serious right in the morning so I think we can take a few seconds to just smile. Um so uh climate is such a wide field it's very difficult

to make a assessment where and which models are getting the highest play in terms of its impact on governance its impact on uh policy on implementation on the ground or but I can pick one or two

areas where I work and and or may I don't work that much in certain areas but um where I think there is the highest possibility of impact and we al already starting to see how the models

are getting utilized and I think the two areas that I would like to highlight is disaster management and impact assessment. Now in terms of disaster management, it's more like a vertical

than an area and everything under the sun kind of falls in disaster management starting from flood risk, landslide risk, storm surge, uh you know coastal risk, all kinds of risks fall into this

domain and you will see in the past uh three to four years there has been almost a you know there has been a deluge of AI models in this area coming out coming out of labs from across the

country as well as across the world and of course from companies around the world. We have Google with us in a panel. So they will talk about their models. But you will see a lot of which

didn't used to happen till five years back. Companies never really paid much interest to this kind of modeling. It was always the forte of research labs. But now more and more you are seeing

this models because the companies are seeing obviously some financial value to this models. But at the same time its impact on people is so large. like being able to develop and deploy a national

landslide model for example not only makes our infrastructure more sustainable but it also there is a lot of research that actually goes into the model. So it allows us to kind of

connect our students to and researchers to cutting edge work that is happening. So I I think disaster management is one area where AI models have made a large impact and we will start seeing its

integration with uh government systems from now on. And the second part is impact assessment. So I think this is a very important area. So traditionally people have always stopped at hazards.

Most of the modeling efforts have always concentrating on forecasting a hazard. How can we forecast? Can we forecast two days in advance, 5 days in advance? But often times what we are interested in

knowing is if we are able to forecast it well, can we actually forecast how many buildings will get damaged or are is there any proper is there any risk to a dam or a reservoir or a bridge that is

downstream? Is there any risk to that area? So what we are more interested in is actually impact assessment. But now with the kind of geospatial tools that are coming in, it's possible to do large

scale risk assessments. Earlier risk assessments would always be sight specific. Now I'm a civil engineer by training. So my field is entirely sight specific. But now this is we are also

making a transition to more being a sight specific field to a large scale field because it is now possible to do risk assessments at scale. So I think these are two areas that I see large

impacts of AI being already in place and more and more we'll see it being integrated with government systems. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you. We'll we'll talk about both of those uh as we proceed along the

panel. But since you talked about uh both disaster management will also you know impact assessment in advance. Um maybe I'll turn to UK um you know across the world digital public infrastructure

has scaled significantly. India made it a point to highlight the potential during its G20 presidency. um but we haven't seen it scale enough when it comes to climate action, climate

resilience. So could you reflect a little bit on how we can integrate AI onto a DPI stack and bolster the climate resilience aspect which has perhaps been little less uh uh uh explored and and

impacted so far? &gt;&gt; Yes, sure. Um this one. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, first of all, I just want to thank the council and Google for inviting me. Um, this is very exciting.

I was uh discussing with a colleague earlier that we usually worry about, you know, if there are going to be too many empty chairs when we talk about our work. So, this is really exciting.

&gt;&gt; Um, so &gt;&gt; hey, could I request you to hold it a little closer to your Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that better? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay.

&gt;&gt; The the den outside is trying to drown us. We have to be resilient against drowning. &gt;&gt; Of course. Of course. All the excitement. It's wonderful to see. Um,

so I want to just add one little caveat. So, uh, I'm with the Digital Impact Alliance. We're a not for-profit based, um, out of Washington DC technically, but actually most of our team is

deployed and works in Africa, South Asia, Europe. And we uh, work on a pretty focused scope which is solving for data scarcity and our approach to that is really helping to scale dig

public infrastructure in places where um those foundational layers the public rails uh that India has built out in the last few years still don't exist and uh that leads us to spend most of our time

in subsaharan Africa where there's great enthusiasm uh but there uh is still a work in progress in terms of building out these systems and so I would say there are a

couple of different ways to think about your question of why this uh digital public infrastructure movement over the last few years has not delivered climate action. And I would say first um it

really is this idea that it's still scaling. And second, um, the, uh, the really foundational layers that are being put in place first tend to do with personal identity, unique identity, just

like AAR here, and um, and payments, whether B2B or P2P payments. And so I think that there is a sense that um there is a lot of relevance to climate but the use cases and the applications

are not perfectly obvious yet very clear. So it's a maturity problem but also kind of the starting point. Um a big part of the DPI movement was actually accelerated by uh by the

pandemic five years ago when there was more urgency and more interest in um stimulus payments and welfare payments out to people who were being um financially disrupted. So, I think we're

going to get there. But I would say the second um real gap that's keeping DPI from being um directly applicable to climate action is the fact that geospatial data in particular hyper

local geospatial data in urban areas in countries that are really on the front lines of of climate change just either doesn't exist, right? There's a scarcity problem or um highly highly fragmented

and so that's the work that we are helping to um to address right now and it's you know this I think there's this idea that mapping has been solved in part because Google maps is so good

right um but in truth there are a lot of places especially in urban areas in countries where the demographic shifts moving from rural areas to urban areas are changing so quickly um the mapping

at a really local level is is not able to keep up. And so I think the things that we have to think about are how do you solve for that scarcity in a way that is um financially sustainable,

right? Because everyone says satellites, you know, or it's already taken care of and in fact um countries don't have uh don't have the budget to keep constantly updating through those means. Um so we

look at business model innovations right there are some really interesting experiments around not thinking about geospatial data as just private infrastructure but as a public even

maybe clubbed goods right so more of a digital rail that allows public and private innovation on top of it and has a business model for being constantly updated and maintained and then I would

say the other piece is the fragmentation data um which is already discussed and I think is a big focus of the council's work which is how do you get this data to work together so that it can be

applied to uh to climate action &gt;&gt; indeed I think you've highlighted the several gaps a gap in the imagination a gap in scale a gap in you know our our our hyper local mapping and geospatial

information and then of course uh even if we fill those gaps they that still exist in silos. And uh some of the things we've been doing at the council uh neighborhood scale flood mapping,

flood risk mapping for urban centers. And you're exactly right. It's not just about mapping the the urban center. It's about mapping the economic activity in different neighborhoods. the different

economic classes there uh who someone living in a shanty town is going to be a lot more vulnerable than someone living in a paka home even with the same intensity of a flooding event. So I

think layering it with these issues of equity, economic activity, vulnerability, adaptive capacity will be necessary. So that's a great segue to u my question for Dr. around Prasad um

because you deal with water supply and sewage in one of India's uh most tech enabled cities um and yet BWSSB has now of late used AI to improve water pumping efficiency um what in I recall when I

started CW uh one of the first things we did was run water dialogues in Bangalore and SCADA systems etc were being considered at that time so what is missing in the sort of traditional

infrastructure and the manual mapping of leaks etc that you're trying to plug through AI and how effective has that been for you. Thank you for the opportunity. uh I can

see the mass massive interest in the youngsters to know about how these models can be used in the mosses to the case study of the Bengal water supply board can be a

demonstration for what the questions so traditionally all the utilities across the India are pumping water simply without knowing what's happening after pumping so in BWSSB we have faced a

critical challenge during 2020 that summer water crisis in Bangaluru. Uh due to which we have been uh forced to think beyond the conventional model and we have started thinking in the

technological front then the A was the one which was coming up in the way. So we thought we should integrate the AI models into actual governance model. So in the in the current case scenario what

BWSSB has done has made an IoT enabled sensors to assess the pumping capacities and pumps health monitoring and uses data with a analytics to predict how these pumps are very efficiency uh in

terms of design and also in terms of field pumping efficiency and what are the maintenance cost involved and how it can be uh predictively analyzed. This is the first and foremost important thing.

So that we could be able to understand how the water pumping is going to behave. The supply adequacy is there or not in the system can be very well effectively can be monitored using the a

enabled data analytical tools that is being demonstrated in Bangalore water supply. uh more than 78 pumping stations have been uh fitted with a enabled IoT system sensors and we are getting the

predictive analytical tools which we are effectively using both to monitor the efficiency and to improve the efficiency. It's not only a monitoring device also it's a functional actuating

device. Apart from that we have also used one of the important tool to monitor the groundwater system. You know in 2024 when the crisis happened the major problem is due to the groundwater

uh depletion in the system. So which is very difficult to monitor for a conventional methodology where the AI enabled IoT sensor which is fitted in the bore world systems uh as a

monitoring bor devices more than 3,000 bwells have been fitted across the city to understand the groundwater uh behavioral patterns. So with this uh we have collaborated with Indian of science

one of the leading institute of the nation who have come forward to develop a a enabled dashboard to monitor the ground water analytics. So with this analytics in 2025 we could able to

forecast how this uh groundwater will deplete in specific areas. So we could be able to target those deficit area with the enhanced efficiency through the surface water system. That's how I think

the AI tools can be very well effectively to counter the uh challenges of the nature as well as to prepare for the nature's challenges to uh foresee the various challenges coming forward

and in fact this is a case study which we have presented to the world &gt;&gt; wonderful wonderful and I hope Uh these are two models that use geospatial data to be able to help build

out the agricultural information. And the goal here is um as our colleagues talked about um really spatial resolution is critical. farmers make decisions at a local level and so they

need really localized information to be able to drive uh the the resiliency that they need. Um, again when I was because you know it does start to get very very granular. And um you know I

love this saying I just learned this yesterday that um DPI makes uh makes things possible and AI makes things personal, right? And so when you have those two together, you have this

ability to innovate in ways that are contextually relevant. &gt;&gt; Super. In fact, that leads me to two follow-up questions I want to ask. One to Professor Asar and one to you Ashley.

Um Ashley if you are seeking that locally relevant data can you give an example or or just what is the process that Google is following to draw on more locally

relevant data to plug into your global models and how do you also ensure that the global models are reflective of those local nodes sufficiently how do you have trust how does a user have

trust that it it does have that relevance And if I could ask you Rosaryia the you know in in this context of we all have to kind of put our shoulders to the

wheel of filling these different gaps making it locally relevant. Um could you expand a little bit on then why data sovereignty becomes particularly important when it

comes to what is it that external stakeholders need to understand to you and then again I'll have a hard question for you.

Yeah, thanks so much. And I just want to state with that, you know, we use public data and our models are only able to be developed because we stand on the shoulders of the giants who have, you

know, really developed this. So, um, I I'll take our weather model as an example. You know, without the aeros data set, our weather next two model would actually not be possible. So, I

think public data is absolutely critical. Um, and so then it's the question of how do you localize? And so I think you know we love making these global models but global models are only

as good as they are um able to drive decision and decisions are local. Um and so it's then through different we have a couple different approaches to how we do that localization. So there's kind of

one mode where we can work at um kind of giving open access to models and then having partners do the localization using their proprietary data. Um we've seen this work with um some of our

weather models. So Weather Next for example. uh we work with organizations like tomorrow now work directly with the partners and they are providing the data and we're able to um really drive up the

accuracy. So CEW is is a great example of you know working in partnership to improve the accuracy of our aid model because we really need to make sure that if farmers are making decisions or if

organizations are making decisions off these models they're as reflective as the local situation as possible but you know we're a research lab and so it's an ongoing question. we really need to make

sure that we have the most kind of up-to-date data and if there's data available we are able to you know drive those partnerships. So again it's working with partners and those um

organizations who have that last mile access. &gt;&gt; Was this all right? &gt;&gt; Hello. Hello. So two-part answer and one is related to kind of governance/

national security and one is kind of technical in my opinion if if we just look at AI as just another model or just another tool then probably I think there's a lot of confus not confusion

but if we think of it just as a model and a tool then probably the question of sovereignty doesn't arise but if you do agree and I believe that it is a new paradigm of computing like tomorrow's

operating system is going to be entirely AI based computing I think Windows, Linux, all of them will get reinvented over the next few years. And if you think of it that way, if it

were 1980s today, we would never think about renting a computer, right? We bought the computers into the gun into into the country. You know, the IT revolution started because government

imported the computers and kind of trained the bureaucracy and of course the private industry also took over. Now, if it were like 20 years back, we would not think about renting a

supercomputer from US and Europe, right? Right. We've built our own supercomputers. The param 10,000 and all these other supercomputers that we've built kind of helped us to kind of re

build our people and infrastructure in that area. And this is the next big platform, next big paradigm. And I don't like to use the word use an AI model because I think it gives people the

false sense of control that you are using something and you are actually not using it. You are renting it. Right? I'm renting a model from somewhere. Whom am I renting it from? If you rent a

computer, you'll start have a very different relationship with your device. Right? So I think it's very important for our country that it has control over the layers starting off all the way from

chips all the way to the analytics that feeds into the government and private system. So that's one question and I think the summit itself is kind of surrounding that theme anyway. So I

don't need to elaborate on that point. Now the second question is technical in that suppose you want to improve the models. Now a lot of the land use data for example a lot of the satellite data

they all come under uh for various reasons they are private data sets right space agency right now ISRO open sources data up to 5 m not beyond so it is not beyond so it is not possible to get

access to this data and feed them to a global model so weather land geospatial they can be global but then at the same time it also has a local context in that India collects a lot of his own data

sets and how do we get how do we actually use these data sets if we don't know how to train our models with our students are not trained our faculties are not trained our ecosystem is not

trained to using these models how what would we even do with these things so I think this question arises that how do we utilize and for that having the expertise in house is super important

and of course we collaborate with everyone we are open to the world but as Mahatma Gandhi said let's have the windows open let the air flow in but let us not have the window blown out the

whole I don't remember the whole code but let us have not have the entire house print out blown out so I think this part is very important that we build our students our research base in

this area and that is going to give us the control over the layer so that we can continue to improve these models for planet climate impacts and host of other areas are getting impacted by these

models climate is a very uh kind of sustainability good do like it's a do good kind of goody goody feeling word but this has implications for governance, security and a lot of other

very serious matters. So I think it is very important for us to listen. Thank you. That leads me to my last question to Dr. Aarat and then see if we have time for a couple of questions before we

request our Google colleagues to close it out. this issue that professor Sara brought up about capacity he said it in the kind of technical context but I my question to you is in the administrative

context um from where I analyze this I see capacity gaps in analytical capacity interpretive capacity and then actionable capacity you know so while you can deploy the sensors you can use

the AI to you know whether it's the groundwater the leaks etc But how are you could you explain a little bit at BWSSB? How are you building the capacity to

understand all this and then act on it? India very good question because everyone today talking about artificial use of it in governance but in India we are dealing with 140 plus population and

the government is a single entity which is having predominant role in many of the uh nor function of the human life in India. In this case when we are using the A we

have to think about uh how to use this A for uh effectively function. When you say that we have to effectively function, you have to also build the capacity to make it uh more effective.

For that the human elements is very very critical and I can see lot of young people gathered here but uh maybe except me less people are in the government system who are in the dialogue or

learning process but always there is a resistance of change. So when you introduce a computer system in the governance always there was a resistance lot of resistance the same way what

Google put the security of the data all those issues keep coming whenever you introduce technological models or innovations into the system but having said that we can't keep resisting the

ideas we have to keep accepting the ideas and build up uh our workforce for the future in our beginning when we started implementing this AI enabled system uh not only in water water

pumping station and water pumping station needed for the seaweed water treatment purpose because of the sewage treatment plants are running across city which is spread across 800 square kilome

area. So it's very human for a human being to sit and control the operations of the civic treatment plant in that body small device

to get the data and analyze and give the input to the field level officials to sit on what are the things to be done the protocol to be followed. So when we started we realized that the level of

function is who are going to use this a relation decision and in the field uh it's not automated things are still so we have to balance between existing conventional system of control and the

innovations of the a so unless we bridge this gap of understanding between the elements who are going to implement the a model and the person who g back end so then We started developing

and models and train our own stuff in the field to understand how to use this a system and with this uh capacity building now we able to successfully uh use this a enabled uh seage treatment

plan management system which is saving us more than 25% of the cost which turned out to be,000 crores rupees per year. So it's not a small thing but for every system they have to enable the

that's the human element we have to build the capacity not only in terms of the working force working in the government also we have to make the consumer our consumer is a large citizen

unless our citizens are not able to understand what is that what we are trying to do then ultimately the effectiveness will come down even we going ahead with the consumer oriented

B2C uh a tools like the smart me technology so that they can effectively use the smart meters to monitor their uh water efficiency, how well they can prevent the water uh shortages in their

home to that level we want to micromanage. So for that so from the head of the department that information and the capacities will perate down to the implementing agencies and also to

the citizen at the last minute. So this is how we have to move further and the government is taking effort and this is one such effort of the government to bring together all the stakeholders of

the government to create the awareness and then action unless you aware about something you can't act upon and this is government is in the right direction and government has already enabled the

system and it is in the process definitely uh we will able to catch up with expectation of mering a into the you need to you need to have a digital

carer joining your your your uh administrative services. Now uh in fact we'll have a session CW will have a session with LinkedIn later this afternoon on the jobs and the skills

needed for this future that we are all building together. We maybe have time for two very short questions for two very short answers before we request Google to close out. So, can we have

some young person ask a question first? &gt;&gt; The red t-shirt at the back. &gt;&gt; Um, we're recording it. So, just please pass the microphone.

Very quickly, please. First of all, thank you for giving a chance to ask the question and uh I have two questions uh two short questions to the panel. First question is like uh we

are building uh in agriculture sector we are using AI technology and uh in USA we know that farmers own large lands and they are capable of hiring these agents like they are capable of bearing the

cost but considering India we have small scale farmers so is uh like we have a barrier uh considering the okay so the cost cost barrier I'm afraid I'll have to stop you at one question so you are

very eager you can ask your question yeah thank you Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for your excellent section. S I am from uh director mechanized former company JK.

Uh my big question is can we without uh from the panelist can we robust digitization of land farmers and crop data? Yeah. Can AI reach the last mile in agriculture?

Super thank you. There are two very important questions. One, the affordability for access to these tools for smaller farmers and secondly in the absence of digitized land records. Are

we actually leverage any of these? Who wants to take I mean Ashley you will be the spotlight on you but anyone else wants to be brave enough to answer this. &gt;&gt; Um well on the first question um are

that the models are available without cost? Um I think it's agree with Google.com. Feel free to fill out a form. It's a landing process

land digitization. Uh anyone wants to take a stab at this. It's a partially government system. So I have the responsibility to answer this question. So landization is very much uh

uh in very staggered states. Some of the states like Karnataka uh Tamil Nadu are very progressive in implementing their land for last two decades. In fact is the first state to start with the land

and we have gone even the class data and survey everything is being done through the digital mechanisms and the gas system. So we are very much prepared but there is the other part of the country

like northern states and uh eastern states still in the uh process of digitization of the country but of course this is a data for any uh uh uh system which

data system. to assist what we can do. uh we can make it as a those states who are not having the data

to come to the data first and those who are having data starting this uh digital uh system uh using the so that follow uh okay

Quickly, I would say there's been so we we need to respect everyone's time. You can take it off. Uh &gt;&gt; we just quickly from the DPI world lens like I think property mapping updating

cadastras is not a techn technical problem or technological problem. It is purely a political problem. And I do think that there is a way to match um AIdriven solutions with places uh that

can still be incredibly beneficial to small farmers even without that. &gt;&gt; President, you had a thought on this as well on it. It's been covered. It's a political problem, not a technology

problem. I've heard four words that matter to me. Um trust in an increasingly untrusting world. uh partnerships therefore that we got to kind of break down new barriers uh

capacity not just at the data end but at the administrative end and ultimately citizen I think Dr. uh Prasad what you said the customer is also ultimately the citizen and that citizen focus is

needed. Um so thank you for this extremely energizing panel and if I could pass it back to Kunalika uh and and you can close us out. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much uh dear panelists

for that insightful conversation. It gives me great pleasure to invite Mr. Rajani head of Google research and applied AI partnerships to frame today's context

with his keynote remark. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I think we're running short on time, so I'm going to try and show you this part. Um, it was a pleasure to be here. I I really enjoyed the panel. I

think you closed it out really beautifully there. I love the DPI and AI um theme as well that you talked about. Uh, I think we all know the weather events are increasing and Asia obviously

is at the forefront of a lot of the vulnerability to the impacts of a warming climate. Um I'm going to skip to the part where we at Google research have Ashley and I we our teams are

committed to sort of bringing the best of our frontier models and having impact on the ground. I think we talked about this example. I'll just spend a minute on it. Um farmers are obviously the the

backbone of the Indian economy. They are on the front line of the climate volatility. Um the Indian government has already announced plans through mission to use AI and machine learning to

improve scientific understanding and prediction capabilities of uh India's wealth of weather and climate data. We talked about it a bunch in the panel. Excellent farmer registries to

the extent that they exist. Um and investments in digital platforms have have really allowed made it possible to scale forecasts effectively. I want to mention one initiative that that we had

a small role to play in. Um during the last summer monsoon, the Indian government leveraged statistics from the Met department and they used two AI models which best predicted the

localized onset of monsoon. One of which was a Google research model called neural GCM which is a model that combines traditional physics with machine learning to provide hyperlocal

forecasts. Uh it was a very interesting approach. The ministry was able to warn warn these farmers about an unusual year in which the monsoon arrived early in Kerala but its northward progression was

actually slow. So it got paused and so without this forecast farmers would have actually planted too early and uh by disseminating this AI found insight and using the government statistics of 38

million farmers across 13 Indian states. Um they avoided premature planting and uh so these are small pieces of information but they allowed they saved farmers from wasting expensive seeds and

fertilizers protecting some of their income and food security. Google will continue to invest in these digital public goods so that governments can follow examples of the Indian

government and and show the world how this kind of AI uh along with a strong institutional base and a powerful dissemination channel can be used in programs. One quick case study to to end

with is on flood management. We talked a little bit about floods and the fact that data scaps right hyperlocal flood data is really scarce. uh we've been working to scale flood forecasting to

millions of people in India but again the forecasts are only as powerful as the action that they enable right so in Bihar we partnered with the Yale economic growth center to test the real

world impact of flood alerts and the results are really powerful so I just wanted to share that with this group today um around 35% less spend on illness treatment and 9% less spend on

injury treatment if early forecasts are disseminated for for rivering floods This is the example that was used for the case study. The economic case is undeniable. For every dollar spent in

disseminating these alerts, uh between 12 and $36 were saved per household when it came to medical expenses. So I I want to ground that AI is not just a luxury or a good to have. AI informed warnings

are a cost effective tool for public health and economic stability. So I just wanted to, you know, give these quick examples and and and as the panel talked about, technology cannot and should not

do any of this alone. The transition from models to masses really requires the partnership of everyone on this panel, everyone in this room, it's it's policy makers, it's organizations like

like the council, it's the partner ecosystem. And so I just wanted to thank everyone for the time today and to commit that we're not here just to build better models. We are here to build a

safer and more resilient pilot. So thank you so much FOR THE TALK. [applause] THANK YOU DR. B FOR moderating this session. I invite Saj Bharatas for mighty team and our officials just give

a momentum to everybody. Next.
