## 📝 Transcript

Runstack the second company I would like to call the founders on stage. Big round of applause guys. Um hello so when uh today in India for an MSME to resolve a dispute it takes

about 600 days a while ago it was about,400 but now through a lot of effort we've got to 600 we want to bring that down to 60 and that's basically our entire stack. Now how we do it is

preemptively we start and ensure that we're at the enterprise data level so that dispute tracking and discovery occurs on day minus one. We have partner laws across the country and with today's

stack we're able to automate about 90% of the litigation argument flow itself and we've been live for about 2 years. The high court is a client. Uh last month the government of Karnataka

processed about 350 cases through us. For example, what we actually end up delivering for a business is for lending institutions. We help them recover twice as better. Insurance companies get about

two quarters heads up in actually figuring out what litigation is coming towards them because we track crime report data and everything around whatever leads to insurance claims.

Lastly, for construction arbitrations where uh we have clients who have about lacks of pages of files, effectively we're able to do discovery on day minus one. Now our thesis is very very simple.

We think that uh any move in court changes the entire state space of available options for other folks. If I take action X that just means that my opponent can take only four more actions

and that really changes how people end up litigating. And that's a deep deep indic AI problem where we're able to train models to actually reason at court level and code strate strategies. And

that is basically how we do it. Now why we say that we can actually crunch down time of dispute resolution itself is because a model that can figure out every path or what part to take in code

can also figure out whether an applicable path itself can be ruled in a specific way. And that implies that you might at some point have an AI judge. That's about it. And our thesis is

fairly simple. Again, any event in society can be framed into a question of law. That's basically what courts do. Courts figure out what question of law to answer. But with an AI judge, as long

as you have a large space of questions of law, you can figure out whether it applies to any given case. Thank &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Uh uh we would also like to thank Ankur

Capital Fund for investing 32.7 crores to support two startups. First I would like to call the folks at Turyam. Uh they're developing a compute platform. Yeah, sure. Uh, if it doesn't show up,

this means &gt;&gt; guys can. &gt;&gt; So, thank you so much. I know it's been a long, you know, set of presentations. I do find it fantastic that there are so

many customers in the room for us. Uh, we are a very simple company. We make GPUs. We make GPUs for infants. Our clear value prop is we are 5 to 10x better than Nvidia in terms of

performance per watt. We also have a booth at hall 1.16. Please do visit us. We are demonstrating quen van and all the suda models over there. Right. Um our vision for AI computers data center

inference would drive almost 10x more volumes than in training. So think about it almost 1.2 to 1.5 trillion has been spent on training in the last 5 years. Uh training is a means influence is a

business. So technically you need to generate almost 10 trillion worth of value to go ahead and justify the amount of capex that has gone into training. Right? So that's the vision and you see

that the world is changing right now with Nvidia buying graph one of the companies I work for. Uh we also believe open source models we have a slide to actually show you that how open source

models are getting very close to closed source models almost like 10% on the efficiency side especially on the models which are less than 70 billion parameters not the trillion parameters

model. Sovereign AI is one thing I think which everybody talks about and I think you need to own the entire stack because the GPU stack is very different. &gt;&gt; Wow that's fast. Okay.

Uh quickly on the team um uh me and Prag went to Kakur he went to Stanford we worked at Grock AMD and stuff went to UI and he was at AMD and Intel running the entire AMD stack uh for uh Rockam. Show

me our software architect. He's from ID Delhi and AMD and Qualcomm. Uh this is basically 5x soft better in touch infirmance software CUDA free kernels and open architecture software defined

that's all we have thank you &gt;&gt; oh yeah this one come visit our booth we have some interesting demos &gt;&gt; thank you so much to uh the next company we have is craftive.ai Hey.

Uh, yes, please. You have you have two minutes. &gt;&gt; Hi everyone, my name is Pratik Sharda. I'm the founder and CEO at Craftify. Uh the vision for us at Craftify is to

shape the future of embedded software development with the help of agent platform deliver smart device seamless end to end solutions. Um uh you know uh the problem statement that we're trying

to uh tackle here is that the software development that bunch of you would have heard heard during this forum on the IoT devices computer vision platform is difficult time taking expensive to build

um whether it's be a firmware development for IoT device which works with a lot of driver or nuances for every different chip which creates a lot of uh you know takes a high development

time to be able to make one set of firmware. Similarly on the high-end devices like a robot, drone, uh AI camera, there's a there's a model that you have to build, you have to deploy on

edge. Uh then there's data drift issues which happens. So how do you manage bunch of these parameters? Something that we are trying to figure out with the help of agentic model and uh and

give this platform to a embedded engineer who can use this across different forums. Uh so this on the this some bit on problem statement uh what we have built is a craftify orbit agent AI

based software development suite that automates the entire uh development flow for uh embedded edge IoT devices. Uh it constitutes three key products in the overall suite. One is pipen that

generates deploys hardware optimized persistent pipelines for edge devices. We are live with Nvidia Jetson and the other edge uh device as well. Firm gen is something that uh generates a

hardware optimized code for microcontrollers and IoT devices. uh we are live with ASP32 and SD microcontroller on this one. Agent is something uh that generates a FPJ

designs and deployment ready bit streams. So with these three products in the mix we are able to complete the entire emirate suite. Uh the results have been fascinating when we have

deployed this with the early enterprises and OEMs. We were able to save 70% of their development cost reducing 10 member team to a two member team. Thank you so much. Fast tracking of the

timelines and superior quality production code. &gt;&gt; Thank thank you so much Pratik. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Uh next let's hear it for Antler Innovation Fund 1 which has

made a total investment of 21.8 crores across a few startups. Please welcome Armory one of their investments. They are building counter drone solutions. [snorts]

&gt;&gt; Hi everyone. Um we are all seeing what is happening in Ukraine and Russia and uh I mean clearly drones are the future of warfare. Uh a $500 drone can go and damage billions of

dollars of worth of assets. Uh something similar happened in Russia where they damaged $7 billion of aircrafts. We have seen it firsthand in operation Synindur. That was our first drone war. That is

the uh trailer and this is how it's going to go uh uh you know going forward. U nations are scrambling to fight this enemy. um they are going to spend

hundreds of billion billions of dollars in the next 10 years. Uh India itself will be uh spending $2 billion uh in in next 3 years to buy counter drone systems.

Um so what are we doing about it? Uh I am an aerospace engineer from ID Bombay. Uh 18 years back u I had pioneer India's drone revolution as a founding member of IDEA Force which is the first uh drone

defense company in India. Uh went public. Uh but today I'm on a new miss mission uh to build India's defense against the very drones that I helped build earlier.

Um we have built an AI engine which can uh do realtime processing of radio signals through which we can detect drones and classify them. Uh using this as a foundation we have built a product

called surge which can detect drones at 5 km and then jam them at 3 km away. Uh in a very short span of time we have done incred incredible progress. We have secured 100 crores worth of uh orders

from ministry of defense. Uh that's our vision and &gt;&gt; thank you so much Army. &gt;&gt; A big thank you to Piper Erica for their 34

for for investing 34 crores uh for this cause. Um let's welcome Yubic Edge on stage. founders, we have one. Oh, I'm getting more screen time than the

founders at this point. &gt;&gt; There you go, sir. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Uh, hello everyone. Uh, I'm the Patil, CEO and founder of Ubiage. So India is the world's largest physical AI

laboratory of course 1.4 4 billion people, massive infrastructure. But then AI needs ground truth. Okay. So when we look at AI and IoT, there are three stakeholders. Tech creators, companies

like us, system integrators who have deep uh sector expertise, be it water, be energy, be metal, and then field engineers. Now talking about field engineers, they afraid of coding,

anything near to coding. System integrators, they have ideas but then can't deploy and depend on tech creators. Uh so there's a massive bottleneck between tech creators and

system integrators and few amongst field engineers. This is what uh we are solving. We created an AIO OS infra uh AI engine, a cloud platform called Sama and hardware platform called Cleon. Just

write prompts in Hindi, English, English. The devices get autocoded, the dashboards get created and the solutions get deployed. So now instead of 15 20 use cases, we are deploying 5,000 plus

use cases. So um just to clear it out we have 25,000 plus deployments. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; So so I think we are done with most of

the pitches. I'd really um appreciate all the uh proactive support we got from the venture ecosystem and the founders to make this pitchfest possible. I'd like to give a final round round of

applause for both the VCs and the founders who have made this possible and uh the entire mighty staff especially Dr. Mr. Sabishek Singh, Panish Salam and everybody for making this happen. Thank

you. Thank you all. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you sir. &gt;&gt; For the for the AI for social good cause. Can I request the jury and all the 10 startups to assemble outside?

will announce the winners outside since we've run out of time here. Everyone on this side. May I request all the jury members for the market access track and the special

guest to kindly assemble outside MR6 the gate where the honorable minister had entered there is you may use baggets also. So,

me and thank you all for being here today. I am Rushali Savan. I work at SAS where I get to work at the intersection of AI ethics, governance and social impact. And I'm thrilled to be part of

this panel today. We are here because the stakes couldn't be much higher. You must have seen with the amount of enthusiasm that is outside and it is rightly translated into the

economic impact that is going to do about $15.7 trillion are going to be pumped into the global economy by 2030 view due to AI. Okay.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. But here is the real truth. The wealth that is going to be generated, it's not going to be distributed evenly with Latin America getting only 3% of the share, South Africa, Africa, Oceania

and other Asian nations getting only 8%. But here is what the crucial thing is. the global south, the countries in Africa, Latin America, Asia are the ones who have the majority of

the youth population, right? And they have a distinct advantage. We have the distinct advantage of designing for cleaner, more sustainable and more equitable AI systems by

inculcating the principles of responsible AI while we are building it. So we are at a advantage a lot and that's what recoding the AI economy means. It is about building the AI

systems that are reflecting the values of our society and we are fortunate enough to have a panel over here coming across from the US, Africa, UK, India and they they're full of this great

vision and thoughts about how the global majority especially the global south can build these systems which are more responsible. Let's dive in. I'm going to

give a quick introduction of the panel over here. We have Reggie Townsen. He is the vice president of AI ethics, governance and social impact at SAS leading the global practice focused on

ensuring AI systems are designed for human empowerment and equity. Next I have Rachel Adams. She is the CEO and founder of global center on AI governance and a senior fellow at the

University of Cambridge and her expertise is in the intersection of AI geopolitics and human rights. Third, I'm delighted to welcome Ambassador Philip Thego. He has come

down all the way from Kenya here. It's an honor for us to have you on the panel. He is the special employee for technology to the president of Republic of Kenya and was appointed by the UN

secretary general to the high level advisory board on artificial intelligence. Welcome Philillip and I'm delighted to have Mr. Kazim Rizby here on the panel. He is the

founding director of the dialogue which is the India's leading tech policy think tank and founder of core AI the coalition for responsible evolution of AI in India. Thank you Kazim.

Today's discussion is grounded into the report which we worked with Rachel's organization to and which is known as from capability to constraint. There is a QR code on the screen which you can uh

look take a look at the report and our discussions is to be grounded on that. Kicking off the first segment of our discussion. There are in total four segments to this particular panel. The

first one being AI literacy talent opportunity. How can we build the capacity in the global south and how can we position global south as the leader in AI literacy.

So across the global south when I came here and I saw the enthusiasm the demographics that is interested in knowing what AI is and how can it help for the social empowerment it is amazing

that's the energy is just awesome right and there are numbers to prove that about 80% of Indonesian 77% of Thai believe AI will be more beneficial than harmful, right? But we have to keep in

mind without the baseline literacy around AI, we need they need to be in a position where they can question this AI systems which are going to be used to make decisions about their credit, about

their jobs, about their health, right? So how can we make sure that we are in a position as a global south to make the right decisions of AI literacy? And keeping that thing in mind, my first

question is to Reggie. Uh Reggie, you work at a major tech company which is expanding the AI literacy programs through public private partnerships, right? And the data shows that there is

great optimism like I mentioned uh some numbers there how people are excited about this new technology. How can we design the literacy programs that can go beyond just oh AI is present

or awareness to actual capacity building with equipping our citizens, policy makers, organization, general public so that they can question why the AI is making the decisions, why they are uh

why the AI is being the way it is used. Is it a technology for the sake of technology or is it creating an impact? right the uh going back to the core of the uh summit here. So what does that

deeper level of AI literacy require? &gt;&gt; So that's a good question Rashadian. Thank you. Good afternoon. Um so so no it it should not be technology for techn sake. Let's just get that part

out. I know there's a lot of ambition and excitement around um pursuing AI. Okay. So what does that mean in your individual jobs? uh roles as father, mother,

cousins, etc. Uh and the truth is it means something a little bit different in each of those uh varying capacities. U I had the privilege of serving on our national AI advisory committee uh back

in the US where I uh we provided recommendations to the white house on um matters associated with AI and I actually authored the uh AI literacy helped to co-lead the recommendations to

the president on that. uh and one of the things that we found was that uh there's a in the US &gt;&gt; and more broadly &gt;&gt; uh there there tends to be uh a

misunderstanding about what AI is right there's this trend toward generative AI as the only AI which is a false falsehood good AI but not the only AI uh and and there's also a lack of

fundamental understanding around the uh what I would call the AI life cycle which goes something like uh data models deployment and and so one of the things that we really wanted

to drive home was that we've got to use the kind of a best of breed approach where government being the great convenor that it is uh the ability to uh coordinate activities industry being the

you know great creators uh that we are uh but then uh the academy and civic organizations being the great uh targeters of markets that they are. You really have to bring all of those

components together in this public private partnership. And again, the goal is not to teach people AI. It's great if people want to become AI engineers and data scientists. We need more of those,

but we also need poets. We also need entertainers and fishermen and farmers, right? And so the underlying AI life cycle curriculum which basically says have a good

understanding for how data is accumulated whether or not it is uh provided with informed consent. All right those sorts of things. Uh have an understanding of the kinds of algorithms

that are driving decisions. Again not at the data scientist level. Not everyone needs to know know what a basian network is but just the fundamental understandings that there's a decision

being made that could impact you that then gets deployed for action out in the world and it could be your action or it could be the action of an agent these days but the point here is just that

foundational understanding is the important piece I draw the parallel to electricity right most of us aren't engineers and know all of the nuances of power generation but we all know that if

we have a iron or refrigerator or a laptop, we can plug it in and get the power that we need. And so we need that same basic understanding when it comes to AI. And you've got to have these uh

this kind of multistakeholder approach to provide that level of information where it needs to be provided because if you just leave it to industry, we're going to train you on what our product

does really well. But I don't think that that will serve uh broader society as as best as it possibly can. &gt;&gt; Those are some wonderful insights, Reggie. And I I think uh you made a

point one technology for technology sake that's definite no and the way that AI literacy has to be done is by taking that multistakeholder approach that is very important and no one like it's not

required that everyone knows all the technicalities behind it but then the basic workings of it and I like the parallel that you draw between electricity and I think uh we all can

relate to back coming back on the policy side of things over here. So my question is to ambassador Thego uh we have seen uh African nations in

Kenya they are experimenting with a lot of local AI related projects right and we have that window of opportunity where we can build that AI capacity. So what are some of the policy in structure that

needs to be in place to ensure that these initiatives not remain local but scale right and what are some of the gaps that you see with what government is doing and with what actually is

needed to help with the scaling of these wonderful projects that have been going on. &gt;&gt; Thank you uh so so much once again and thank you to the global center for

governance for putting this together. I think the truth is that especially if you look at the global south a lot of us who were brought into the high conversation from

a policy perspective um whether it was data protection policies or whether it was the AI strategies um and so I think and and and sometimes I become very honest to say that we we never walked

into this we were basically dragged into this conversation and and so there's almost a mismatch uh with the extent of of of of how then we needed to kind of look back and say how do we make AI work

for the African continent at least for Africa and so I think as some of us have been very clear around how do we ensure that AI is inclusive and so through your global nature and scale nature is why

countries like mine were very much emphatic in getting the United Nations around artificial intelligence so you've seen we've basically um negotiated the first ever UN resolution AI which was

very clear around you know safe secure and trustworthy AI for sustainable development we were very clear in terms of coining that resolution to that extent because an AI must be for

sustainable development not just AI for sake and I agree with you. The second part of course was then how do you ensure that beyond a resolution that it becomes very practical. So again we

negotiated the global digital compact ensuring that we have a compact that that everybody agrees on including private sector to ensure that AI delivers yes for public good but also

brings real incremental economic gain especially for countries that are not AI rich. The third part of course you've seen is is the the science right and that's why I always love

Rachel's work around this right and you've seen the secretary general two weeks ago has announced the panel so part of part of my work in the H lab but also in our negotiations to ensure that

we have a scientific panel so that and that scientific panel is independent and globally representative so that also the science from the global south also informs AI and AI development including

risks opportunities then the the fourth pillar for that was because the technology changes very quickly. you needed to have an inclusive mechanism for dialogue and so I agree with my

colleague when he says you know part of the challenge that has always been around artificial intelligence is the conversation has always been with the technical folks I think everybody

because this is a general purpose technology like electricity we don't have to be electricians but I you know I have an iron box I turn on the B people need to be fluent so I will add always

before literacy fluency right that we need to be fluent to understand the impact of this technology because at the at the end of the day people need to be able to make decisions that matter in

their own lives in this era of intelligence. So when you talk then about a policy posture that needs to be the posture that the posture is not about regulations and guards it needs to

be about knowledge and people's capability to make decisions especially when intelligence is a currency because we focus a lot on the stack right data compute talent but not the end product

which is intelligence and I always believe including global south countries that no one in this era should be forced to outsource their intelligence because For me that's about sovereignity and in

in most cases for people like us it's about freedom and and and self- emancipation. So we cannot have this new colonialism kind of to the extent in that of intelligence.

&gt;&gt; That is one of the deepest things that I've heard. So uh and I like that you tie it to sustainable development and the economic growth because we have to keep in mind the for what purpose of AI,

right? So what are we trying to achieve in the end by using AI? Is it just oh I want to speed up some of the productivity or I need to make some real changes that actually affect most of the

communities. So yeah and definitely policy has a part to play not from the regulation standpoint but then to foster that innovation and actually give direction on the purpose for which the

AI has to be used. So thank you. Moving on to our next segment of the discussion, it is about closing the digital divide, right? When we talk about in infrastructure and some of the

data gaps and I think uh people that are sitting in the audience would definitely understand what I'm going to speak here. So let's uh kick that uh segment here. AI runs on connectivity. We just heard

about electricity and internet and all the storage computer and whatnot. Although nearly three billion people in the global south are offline, only 35% have internet access in the developing

nations versus uh 80% in advanced economies. Now uh countries in Africa that hold 18% of the world population but have less than 1% of the global data center capacity. Now what is AI without

data right and what is when we talk about sovereign data and whatn not. So that's an important point languages. Now that's a near and dear uh topic to my heart.

uh there are 7,000 languages in this globe but only a handful of them were used to train these models that we are looking at right there are a lot of dialects that are spoken in these global

south nation now there are data gaps when you are building these foundation models and not representing the entire 3 billion plus population over there then how are we trying to develop this AI

that is inclusive. Right? So my question to Rachel because of your experience on working with this responsible AI frameworks right uh most of this responsible AI frameworks at this moment

we have seen coming from the global north right now the global north countries like US, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand but the global responsible index that you are

documenting based on your research in the governance leadership you see emerging patterns from Africa, from India, from Kenya. So just wanted uh you to some shed some light like what are

some of the actual learnings from this approaches that could reshape the global standards from a global south perspective and how can global south become one of the leaders in setting

examples for this responsible AI frameworks. Thank you Vishali and um welcome everyone. Thank you so much for joining us here this afternoon. I know there's many competing events so thank

you for being with us here. Um I think your question is very pertinent. I think the kind of quick answer is that global majority governments are already leading the way in defining responsible AI in

its own terms and I think this summit is a very very good example of that where we've moved from narrow ideas around safety and we know these issues are fundamentally important to much broader

much more inclusive issues about what's the societal impact we want artificial intelligence to have and I think in this some way this defines the kind of global majority approach to responsible AI and

AI governance. We don't see global south or global majority countries localizing norms that were established in the global north. What we see is them starting from a very very different

standpoint where right from the beginning they're thinking about critical issues around sovereignity and sovereignity doesn't just mean kind of control over compute resources or

control over the infrastructure. It means does the state have the capacity to protect the rights of its citizens when they may be at threat or where there may be an opportunity to use a

technology to advance them in really kind of new and transformative ways. So I think what we're seeing is a different starting point for southern governments that are not just thinking about how is

AI going to increase industrial growth. How is it going to be a new national asset for us as a country? But rather how can we use this technology to advance our developmental priorities to

uh add public value and how do we think about those kind of critical infrastructure and foundational issues like um connectivity like in in uh building equitable representative data

sets right right from the beginning. So I think this is uh a really exciting area for identifying precisely where we're already seeing southern leadership. So India for example has put

digital public infrastructure squarely on the map as a kind of fundamental to advancing equitable AI outcomes. In Sagal for example, they've developed policy responses to AI that have

centered women and girls education in STEM. Thinking about these kind of issu issues of responsible AI leadership from an equitable perspective from a pipeline position which is much more kind of

thinking through questions of societal resilience. And then the last thing and I mentioned this in a panel this morning in low resource contexts and we see this with with innovation generally where

there is restraint and restriction innovation actually comes out in more exciting ways. So global south governments that face kind of resource constraints and often limited regulatory

capacity are approaching AI governance from different perspectives around public private partnerships and Reggie spoken well to this or to kind of adaptive um public procurement

frameworks. So what we're seeing is the global south is developing these ways of approaching AI governance that is agile from the get-go that is agile and flexible from the get-go and so is able

to respond much better to changing technological um advances and and emerging new capabilities. So for me I think we're seeing the global south kind of expanding what responsible AI means

from the get-go. That is wonderful and one thing one theme if I could take from what you have said is resilience right and uh the way the technology is

moving the pace of it and the the the issues that we face in the global south how are we res resilient enough to develop our technology to solve the problems and that's why which is what is

uh helping frame those governance frameworks. So thank you for that. Now I I will bring Kazim into the discussion over here. And India is a fascinating case study. There is uh I'm just

fascinated always every time I visit and uh again a near and dear question to my heart. India has so many languages. You take Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, there are hundreds of millions of

speakers, right? But uh they are under represented in many AI training data sets. Now there are initiatives from Indian government related to Bahashini AI to make sure that we have that uh

robust data sets available in those languages right and I I I potentially see there will be a lot of innovation in this area to create AI that will cater to the needs of that population. Against

this backdrop, what it would take institutionally, technically and collaboratively because we are talking a lot of about multistakeholder approaches here to help

speed up India's uh uh sovereign AI uh related ambitions build that is built on the data that is local technology that is local and the languages that can represents the need of the people.

Thank [clears throat] you Vishali. Uh thank you to SAS for u sort of doing this event. Um so I think few issues I want to just bring over here. One is that you spoke about languages

and India has more than 20 recognized constitutionally recognized languages more than 100 five you know 100 to 100 you know different type of dialects and the different regions speak different

type of dialects as well as you move across the country so I think number one uh it's imperative that we have large language models which cater to the needs of Indian languages and to do that we

should look at the use case of digital public infrastructure because we already have proven expertise in terms of building population scale digital systems like Aadhaar like UPI

uh you know DC open network for digital commerce so we need to look at the AI data infrastructure in a similar manner right which means you know you have to have sectoral data trust in let's say

healthcare finance agriculture consent based public data sets you know may maybe like a national AI data repository as well. Uh government is sort of putting a lot of efforts towards those

data sets. The AI coh is one effort you spoke about Bhashini right. So we need to have these data sets for languages in terms of having the technical infrastructure available uh which is the

open network and a network uh of data sets which basically complies with uh the same procedures as it is in the digital public infrastructure. So that's on the infrastructure side. Um

[clears throat] I think the number two is on building large language models, foundation models on which can work let's say in Marathi, Tamil, Hindi, Bengali and other languages. And the 12

startups that have been selected by the ministry are working towards also multilingual models. We are already looking at serum which has built which is building India's large language model

and you know looking to have multiple languages you can sort of if if if you want to use it in Hindi or any other languages you can. So there is already effort which is taking place to develop

full foundation models in multiple Indian languages because as you said the language data set the multilinguality is not represented in the western large language models and I think that's where

Indian large language models will have an edge because they will be able to cater into multiple languages and I think that richness and diversity in the languages will help the models to sort

of perform uh and we already know that server is uh some of the benchmark results are on the level of Gemini um OpenAI's uh uh tool as [clears throat] well and some of the benchmarks we may

also be uh sort of beating these legacy models right so we are already there in terms of uh Indian expertise um so yeah language inclusion in democratic infrastructure is very very important I

think the third point is around uh compute sovereignity and I would like to emphasize AI diffusion is critical towards building uh you know India's u local data local large language model

ecosystem and [clears throat] of course uh you know it's important to ensure that countries like India get access to GPUs to CPUs to TPUs to facilitate the growth of AI but at the

same time also optimize it to the to the need so you know India is going to be the use case capital of application softwares. So for that different compute requirements are there. We are already

building LLMs for that level of compute requirements are there. I think SLMs are the way forward as well with limited compute. So I also want to caution towards this talk that okay do we need

to compete with western counterparts on compute or are we able to be agile and clever in terms of ensuring what we have we can maximize? Yes and no to that question. I think it's a balance in

terms of ensuring that we optimize our compute requirements to the needs of of the country and then let's see how these models perform and I think going forward definitely it'll be important to have

infrastructure which caters to the genai startups and we already have 300 geni startups in India. So for these multilent models to to work at scale it's important to have

that level of compute infrastructure. So I think these three four points are in my opinion important in terms of ensuring India is you know able to scale up uh provide a good uh use case for the

rest of the world and we also invite I mean we already have the leading model developers building for India and we invite them to localize in Indian languages as well right so I think that

that's it's going to be a rich competition and you know it's it's great for the consumers &gt;&gt; yeah definitely and I Once we have that example set up in the

global south, the other countries are also doing the same like Swahili LM is getting developed in Africa and whatnot and you pointed out rightly there is you need data. So data is going

to be very crucial for building the models that are more inclusive because if you don't have uh representation in the data of the population you're trying to serve then it becomes a challenge for

build the AI systems. Moving on to our next section is around the governance. Now I know when I say the word governance some might say that oh is it like going to stifle my innovation? Is

it going to slow down my innovation? But I like to think governance in a different way. It would actually allow and give direction to innovation and rather assist innovation rather than

stifle it. On that note, uh we have some statistics to share. There are 40% of the countries in the entire globe are making investments in trustworthy AI through governance where they are

building ethical standards and guard rails and safeguards right and we see that the global south is rapidly rewriting this playbook Africa's 2024 continental AI strategy it launched

about $60 billion pan-African AI fund and embedded ethics into the entrepreneurship itself. What an example. While India is also looking at mosaic of existing law with the DPDP

act, AI act to govern without stifling innovation. Latin America is moving towards a riskbased framework. So what you see over here is isn't just a conversion

into single model but a multi-olar governance landscape where global south is not a passive player but it has its own voice right keeping that in mind I have my question to Reggie the report

that we just shared it emphasizes the public partner public private partnership uh as central to building that governance like connecting the innovation needs to

the local needs that Kazim just mentioned. But there is an inherent tension. Companies prefer often prefer light touch regulation to move fast because oh

everyone wants to move fast. Why not? How can companies approach that balance and what incentives will actually drive companies to invest in trustworthy AI governance without seeing it as just a

compliance exercise? Uh, look, I'm I'm gonna tie something back to what Kazim said. Um, I I think it's hilarious. I don't know if you even noticed you you referred to uh

Open AI is, you know, having legacy models. Now, mind you, this is a company that has released a model all of not even five years ago. Five years.

So, why does it matter? Since then there's been I don't know how many new you know and so the question about governance versus innovation I I find it's a

hilarious question largely because we start with this premise that scaling our judgment which is by the way how I refer to as governance is somehow

a uh uh uh the antithesis of innovating Right. Um here's the parallel, right? We we have a 50y old company. Talk about legacy, right? Um we've been in the a IML space for that long, right? We've

learned a lot along the way. We've made some mistakes along the way. Probably not a good idea to repeat those, right? And so governance allows us to avoid repeating those mistakes. It allows us

to take the judgment that we've derived, the wisdom that we've derived over those years and embed it in our processes and our policies and our products and in our people.

Right? So the problem with this whole conversation that we've been having specific to generative AI really uh has been about we just have to go fast so that we can win the race the race to

where where are we going right what's the purpose and until someone describes for me that we're going to do something other than create a digital god I you know I just

assume we just slow down where it makes sense to slow slow down. We have to get comfortable with the idea that friction is sometimes a feature. It's okay sometimes to slow down in pursuit of

purpose. So let's define the purposes. Let's understand what the intended uses are. Let's understand who we're trying to motivate, who we're trying to sell, etc.

what the potential harms might be to them as well as secondary and tertiary actors and then let's mitigate accordingly. That's all governance is. We spent a lot of time I refer to my my

um job with doing the work with the white house just thinking about different regulatory schema. We can regulate with speeding tickets. That's regulation, right? We can regulate with

lensure, right? the clinician has to go get licensed. We can regulate by saying thou shalt not, right? This [snorts] is a prohibited use, right? So, there are various ways that we can do it.

Companies regulate all the time. They're called policies, right? We tell our employees what they can and cannot do all the time. This is not new to corporate America. And you learn that

over the course of a little bit of time in the space. That's something that you have given me to chew on and uh to summarize I would say for what purpose to what end for

whom it might fail. That's the uh that's the gist of the government's aspect of the thing that we are trying to discuss here. U I have another question for ambassador Thego. I just mentioned the

uh African Union's 2024 continental AI strategy which was significant like having that $60 billion pumped into for the ethical entrepreneurship in AI right the challenge of some of the frameworks

that and the funding is one thing but the implementation part is the other. Now what do you see are the critical gap between the strategy part and what is actually necessary to implement this

governance that is meaningful at a national level when countries are trying to hassle the other problems already existing. So where do you see the gap between the strategy versus

implementation when it comes to governments in AI? &gt;&gt; I wish I could answer that fully. It's 54 countries. Um I think just I think in terms of just overall a kind of a a

cassery analysis of how we approach it as Kenya. Um I think one is that we have to do the we have to complete the unfinished business and the unfinished business is 600 million Africans still

do not have electricity and not connected to the grid. We've seen the numbers around internet connectivity. We know for sure that um there that there is beyond just electric grid there's an

energy challenge just in terms of the consumption of AI on energy. We know for sure that Africa only has I think 0 something% of compute of the world and only 1% of data center capacity. So

again there's a big infrastructural challenge. So as much as we're thinking about soever a legacy challenge but also we have sort of a a current challenge around how to invest um in in in in AI

capability. The second part of course and and and I look at the strategy and I think it's fine uh because it's to the extent that is very aspirational around African values and I think sometimes we

want to govern technology from a technology lens. I think from the AU we came from a pan-African value in terms of safety, security, inclusivity, sustainability and building public

trust. I think those are the five pillars. If you summarize the strategy, it's really not about technology. It's about technological impact or potential impact on society but also creating

opportunity for Africans. So we we didn't approach AI from a fear perspective. We approach it from a potential capability that the continent needs to wield. But then um

part of I think want to answer your question one is that I think the challenge for me is that we are still applying the old rules into this new very uncertain

and and very transitory uh period and I think for me that's the biggest challenge. So the biggest challenge for me is leadership is is how do we recontour our leadership to understand

that this technology is not ICT it is not and that's a challenge I see so unless we begin to have this mindset shift that people understand that this is a little bit different you need

everybody you need ministers of finance minister of planning not just minister of ICT and not to get me wrong believe me everywhere you walk into you'll meet an African minister of ICT that for me

fundamental in this conference that for me fundamentally is a problem that you need or beyond the leaders one you'll just get ICT folks right so I think for me you need to do that the second part

of course is is is very much around the the people I I mean how do we ensure that we build capacity and capability and fluency so that so that it's it's this is the biggest resource that the

African continent has median age of 19.7 um we don't own compute we definitely have a challenge data and data caps. Um we don't have the infrastructure, we don't have electricity, but what we have

is a talent. So how do we begin to build that and that can happen very quickly and so again the second point for me is that how do we ensure from K1 to K12 to university tertiary education that we

have AI plus not just AI it's if you're doing medicine you also have some fluency around AI if you're doing so it's the other way around it's not to try to get everybody to be a data

scientist and a code and a machine learning expert it's actually um the other way around and I think finally is this finance gap and I know you you hinted at the $60 billion. I honestly do

not believe there's $60 billion available. I don't think so. I'm one of person who's been very skeptical about that figure. But I think it's to the extent to understand that it's not about

again this is an old rules mindset, right? So throw money at a problem and think you solve it. If you did 60 billion last year, believe me, it's different this year. It's probably gone

up, right? and myself and Strive Masua just negotiated 12,000 GPUs from Nvidia for the entire African continent. Think about it. 12,000 GPUs at a billion dollars.

Not much, right? And so what is this 60 billion? So I think there's sort of a resource challenge but also a resource mindset that you need to plan differently when it comes to AI, right?

So it's not about a port. It's about look at the whole of society and reimagine our entire budget to understand what investments do we need to put in talent and the education

system. What investment do you need to put in infrastructure? What investment do we need to put in electricity in connectivity in the use cases and that is why I want to land this plane.

Ultimately it will be about AI solving problems. food systems, health systems, education and learning outcomes, judiciary and justice, um climate and climate action.

So I think for me that's where we need to figure out just beyond the the nice documents that we do &gt;&gt; and that is the kind of and thank you ambassador Figo that was

the kind of thinking and the deep level of thinking. I think the uh common theme that I heard from all the three points that you made here is the mindset and which we can get through the culture

right the culture aspect of it to then leapfrog into these governance framework and make that implementation happen. So uh thank you for that. Now uh back to Rachel uh you you have done a lot of

work with AI governance globally right and this document has shown from the research that you have done that is uh a lot of different nations are taking different approaches Africa has a

flexible approach Latin America has binding laws as have mixed models they're still thinking what uh to be done in the AI governance rather than converging into one gold standard are

like onesizefits all when it comes to governance. How do you ensure that these different plural governance frameworks that you have are going to help in binding or fragmenting the AI

governance and what role you see global south will play in this multilateral standards that are being getting developed across? Yeah, thank you. And I think this

question is particularly interesting given the kind of multi-olar moment we are in globally. I think the first thing we might want to say is that pluralism may very well be desirable

at a global level. We need to remember that AI governance is emerging within very different political traditions and in contexts with very different regulatory needs and and you've just

listed some of them. So expecting a kind of single global framework ignores the fact that governance systems are very much embedded in particular histories and particular political economies.

One of the things we also need to think about is when we are looking for these areas of convergence and we're looking for promoting interoperability, we're not just promoting that whoever has the

most dominant hand. Everybody else must adhere to that particular set of standards. We know from evaluations work. That doesn't work with large language models and the kind of way in

which they are deployed and diffused throughout society. evaluation benchmarks set in the global north or in one particular country and context may mean very little when it comes to

effectiveness, appropriateness and safety somewhere else. So I think we need to be thinking about global governance from a kind of layered perspective where we have a set of

shared norms around accountability, transparency, human oversight and account and and and safety of course that enables kind of crossborder engagement with these

systems. But on top of this layer, countries need to be allowed the space to develop diverse frameworks that respond to their own particular regulatory requirements from this kind

of outcomes perspective which may be in some countries labor markets. Different countries have different unique kind of strengths and opportunities and countries need to be able to kind of

capitalize on that. We also need to recognize that historically multilateral processes and standard setting has been dominated by the players that have the time and the resources to invest the

most in them. Right? So what we want to be seeing is global south actors defining what accountability might look like in resourced constraint contexts. And we need to be thinking there about

who's involved in those conversations and how we're involving publics who need to be able to seek redress where harms occur. We also need to be looking at this kind of middle power engagement.

And now is particularly that moment where we are seeing middle powers united by same trajectory. They're not building frontier technologies. They're adopting AI for their own development priorities

or their own kind of economic imperatives. And then lastly, we need to recognize that the legitimacy of global governance doesn't come through consensus, but from

diversity and that having that diversity and pluralism effectively enables or allows for resilience. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Oh, that is that is wonderful. And I think uh the last statement that you

made about the diversity and the pluralism to eventually get to the global uh governance frameworks that just sums it all and building in resilience. Moving moving on to the last

segment of our discussion and we just talked uh ambassador just mentioned about sustainability right we are using all these data centers compute storage network and we have only one small earth

and we are trying to utilize all these resources so our next section is going to be around how can we build a more sustainable AI and adoption moving ahead Right. And how the global south has that

second mover advantage in it. Just to give some context around data centers and how much of energy it is consuming. Data centers are consuming around 400 plus terawatt of hours of electricity

just in 2024 and that is one just 1.5% of the global use of electricity. Now training a single large language model emits as as much as carbon dioxide as I would take 300 flights from New York to

San Francisco. That's the scale of amount of electricity that we are using to build a single large language model. Yet the global south which has the second more advantage

uh they can build this infrastructure. They can take a stab at building the renewable first data center approach, right? They can uh deploy edgebased AI and potentially embrace the SLM that is

a small language model for context specific task rather than just building one huge and consuming all those uh resources when especially when we are resource constraint. So my question in

this light is to Kazim. How do you feel about uh how do you think the global south's later ar uh arrival in the second mover advantage and how it can avoid the north's

mistakes and build more sustainable system from start like for example India has tiny ML approaches which detect these crop diseases now it's a small model detecting and built for a

particular purpose right so and thus avoiding consumption of lot of energy also using mobile first technology, right? So what does it actually mean to adopt

strategically and to embibe this sustainability by design when you're designing this AI systems for the future and specifically in the context of global south it becomes very important

because we are already resource strained. &gt;&gt; Thank you Bashari. So I [clears throat] think here um three principles are important. One efficiency, two fragility

and three inclusion. And I think it's you spoke about second mover advantage. First of all we have to recognize that we cannot make the same mistakes which we did when the industrial revolution

started right. Uh I mean you you saw [snorts] the western countries Britain etc. you know they polluted much more uh than the global south in those days and of course now we're looking for a

lowcarbon future and I think the advantage with global south in the AI age is that we can look for a lowcarbon AI future and global south can lead that conversation. uh not much time has

passed in terms of how global north has been pushing heavy compute hardware and data centers. Uh you know and you spoke about resources but even look at land and look

at water look at the impact it has on various aspects of um of any particular geography. [snorts] So how do we build models which are more efficient and frugal and I think that's where uh you

know India is looking to innovate and that's where I think a lot of our focus is also to ensure that with minimum compute we can achieve maximum output. Um I do want to highlight uh something

which [snorts] China has done I think with Deep Seek and we've all saw last year when it was released you know and they sort of were able to build cutting edge models with lesser compute power

required and I think you know for good or for bad is something which is important to sort of learn from and see how we can uh emulate and better that uh development.

um on the sustainability part on the infrastructure and sustainability I think here it's important that you know we focus on edge AI as you spoke about uh we spoke we we we focus on

optimization of hardware as I spoke last in my previous intervention as well and we are able to build in sustainable by design practices right from the beginning when it comes to procurement

of hardware procurement of uh you know GPUs or TPUs or CPUs or whatever that may and using it in a way that is bringing the best performance. Um we cannot

afford to have the mentality of uh try and throw you know uh and you know we cannot afford to have the mentality of just move fast and break things and let's see how it goes. build one LLM

doesn't work build another one you know because but at the same time it's important that we democratize AI resources and that is one key element of this conference also that how do you

build an AI diffusion in global south uh you know Africa India and you work with global partners to enable local compute access uh because if you don't provide that eventually

what will happen is you will end up in a situation where there will be a large gulf and a divide which we don't want. Global south is an important market for American big tech companies as well.

Right? So you cannot ignore and you need to walk that talk and you need to build that momentum while at the [snorts] same time it's important for Indian entrepreneurs to focus on efficiency. So

it has to be both ways. If you do not have trust and I think in the climate conversations we see tremendous lack of trust at times you know when we talk about differentiated but common

responsibilities or you know sort of looking at how do we move towards a lowcarbon future different countries have different responsibilities. If we if we have to be towards a lowcarbon AI

future then we have to set the terms of reference and the conditions right now. If we do not agree on those terms of conditions or terms of movement in terms of the scope of the uh the the the

collaboration and what is the terms of moving together then I I think it'll be very difficult because different countries will have different interpretations of what AI diffusion

will mean or what compute will mean or what AI sovereignity will mean. I do agree that AI soenity is not just about compute but it's also about security but at the same time u if sustainability by

design will only happen if there is a regular access of different levels of compute it may not be GPUs it could be TPUs CPUs as well so I do talk about resource optimization but I also talk

about access and democratization of resources so we have to balance it together &gt;&gt; yeah thank you Kazim and uh we'll just wrap it up with one single thought uh I

do think that the global south has a lot of potential and I hope that the global south would be positioned as a leader in developing AI that is more trustworthy, resilient and responsible. And with that

uh we'll close the session. Thank you. Thank you all for being here and thank you for my panelists for being here.
