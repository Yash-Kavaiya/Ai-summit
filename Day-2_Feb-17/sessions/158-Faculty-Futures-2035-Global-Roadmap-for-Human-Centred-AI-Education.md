## 📝 Transcript

I serve as the founding dean of the school of arts of science technology at University Canada West and it is my privilege to moderate today's session. This the future of higher education will

be shaped by the people who teach and what is key here is that we need to acknowledge also our partner in this initiative Dr. TP Singh right founding provice

chancellor of Tandagar University Utar Pradesh his presence reflects the level at which this conversation must take place. It's preparing faculty for AI integrated systems.

Now this panel reflects collaboration across three institutions operating with distinct governance environments in Canada, India and Australia. On this slide you see the colleague who

contributed to the design and facilitation of Whoops. Okay.

So contributed to the design and facilitation of the institutional foresight exercises that inform today's discussion. faculty leaders from Chandigo

University, Utar Pradesh, Canterbury Institute of Management and University Canada West brought forward perspectives shaped by their own regulatory contexts,

institutional priorities and faculty re realities. These were grounded conversations within real time and real institutional environments designed to surface

practical tension as well as structural conditions. Now when we consider when placed side by side these institutional perspectives and reveal

something very important despite different systems as well as different national contexts. Many of these issues are structural pressures that converge together and that

convergence is why this discussion belongs at a global summit here in India. For today's agenda, we will bring those insights into dialogue and we will begin

with a global framing followed by reflections from each institution or institutional context. We will then identify what convergence across systems and what that convergence suggests for

the decade ahead. Okay, sorry. Thank you. So, faculty futures 2035 emerged from the recognition that faculty readiness

must be intentionally designed. It cannot be left to chance, nor that relies solely on individual adaptation rather it belongs to a global framing.

So I would like to introduce Dr. Aya Shilova who is unable to join us here in India but she has prepared a video and I'm hoping to share that with our colleagues here today.

Thank you Dr. Song for that generous introduction and for your leadership in convening this panel. Namaste and good afternoon. My name is Dr. Akirim Shilbeeka and I'm a professor of

strategy at University Canada West. It is a great honor to be part of the India AI impact summit 2026 and share this work alongside with my colleagues from India, Australia and

Canada. Faculty futures 2035 did not begin as an intentional framework or a theoretical concept. It began with a simple conversation between two human beings.

Dr. Ramandep Sei from Canterbury Institute of Management and I had never met in person. We connected online through the AI and education at Oxford University research hub and global

network. What started as a professional exchange became a shared inquiry, a shared ambition to deliver a joint collaborative project. when uh Amandi brought forward this

opportunity of the summit and encouraged us to think boldly. uh welcomed that opportunity because at that time I was sitting with a question that had been growing in my

own research work and the question was if artificial intelligence is reshaping higher education who is preparing or building capacity skilling upskilling the people who hold

the system together the faculty who prepares them for the future that uh is so complex and uncertain for us. That question became the catalyst. So together we discussed multiple ideas

and uh we at ECW uh designed and submitted to proposals uh which were um generously supported by the partners and colleagues at Canterbury

Institute of Management in Melbourne and Chandigar University Uta Pradesh. what which we are very grateful for. So the first proposal was the presummit workshop series implemented through the

center for teaching excellence at University Canada West and across um other institutions and the second proposal is the panel where we move from local conversation uh to a broader

global framing and this is why we are here today. So across uh all these three institutional settings more than a hundred of faculty members and academic leaders engaged in a structured

foresight conversations to explore to share um to discuss changing roles of faculty uh in AI augmented higher education systems. So I would like to acknowledge our

colleagues uh in Australia and in India for their leadership in bringing this work to life locally and uh they did an excellent job there. Before I proceed, I would also like to

express our gratitude um to the leadership of University Canada West in particular Dr. Sandra Song for their generous support of this initiative and for hosting this panel today.

So what is faculty futures 2035? Let me answer that more personally than academically or strategically. Um over the past two years I have been in many rooms where AI was the central topic and

I'm pretty sure many of you have been in those rooms faculty councils policy roundts professional development workshops and trainings research conferences and seminars. The

discussions about AI have focused on many things like tools, adoption policies, detection systems, platform integration, risk management, ethical aspects. Those conversations are

necessary, but they tend to leave unexamined a deeper structural issue. As generative systems become embedded in routine academic tasks, drafting, synthesizing, analyzing, ideiation,

aspects of intellectual labor begin to shift and change. When that happens, uh questions of authority inevitably follow. Who evaluates knowledge claims? Who defines what counts as understanding

or as a learning? how standards are maintained when parts of cognitive work are mediated by external platforms. Faculty futures 2035 emerged from that tension. Um

and it is not an attempt to um predict technological futures or to offer some solutions to the current challenges but rather to create that safe space to for faculty around the world to come

together to think intentionally about the uh roles and authority that's being changing in this context because change will happen regardless. uh and the question is whether faculty

shape it or simply adapt to it after the fact and that is where human- centered AI enters uh this discussion within that framework human- centered AI becomes more um a design orientation. The phrase

is often used rhetorically in some context in higher education. However, it has specific implications. It suggests that accountability for academic standards remains human even with um the

elements of knowledge production being assisted by automated systems. So the central concern is not whether AI should be used. It is how institutions preserve clarity about who defines

academic judgment in environments where technological systems increasingly mediate intellectual work. So human- centered AI then is a way of uh maintaining institutional agency

um when the infrastructural or technological change um takes place um at such a unprecedented rapid pace. And this leads us to the question of readiness. Readiness um that is

frequently described in terms of skills like AI literacy, AI fluency, prompt design, experimentation with tools, integration into the teaching, learning, research and all these are relevant but

institutional readiness is not reducible to individual competence. Uh we believe that it concerns alignment across multiple layers of the university at the individual level, collective level,

institutional level. And when these levels move independently, strain appears not always dramatically but steadily. But when they move in alignment, institutions maintain

stability even as technological systems um change or infrastructural changes happen and in this uh sense readiness is less about upskilling and more about institutional coordination.

So this brings us to what we describe as a strategic horizon toward 2035 or global road map towards 2035 and faculty futures is structured around a set of those questions that will increasingly

shape institutional decision making over the next decade. On this slide you see three of them. The first concerns coordination, the second concerns redesign. The last one concerns

capability and taken together these are not technical questions. They are questions about responsibility about instit institutional agency and about the credibility of higher

education in a period of all this um unbelievable change that we have. Faculty futures um 2035 is our way of approaching those questions deliberately again before

patterns become embedded by default and would be dictated by the technological um forces and with that framing in place I would now like to invite my colleague Dr. Sana

Jamal from the center for teaching excellence at University Canada West my co-lead and uh amazing coordinator of the pre summit workshop series as well as the preparatory work for this panel

and uh I uh would like to invite her to share how these questions were translated into a structured workshop design across Canada, Australia and India and also explain our methodology

and share the prompts that we have discussed across all three contexts during our workshops. Thank you. &gt;&gt; You want to talk? &gt;&gt; She won't hear it.

&gt;&gt; I was just joking. But thank you. All right. Um thank you everyone. Uh I mean thank you for uh recording the and being present at you know in in spirit this one.

Okay. Thank you. All right. Moving forward. Uh I will just skip her slides because you have already seen her slides in the pres I mean in her video that she

shared. So let's start with now. Um let's go back here. Yes. So now to operationalize uh the global framing that I was talking about uh we needed a design a design that actually

can bring out the structural insights from faculty quickly and each institute pilot was structured as a rapid foresight lab and deliberately we chose this methodological choice not as a

perception uh like it was not meant to just be a survey and gather their input. It was not meant to test a hypothesis. It was purposely creating an environment for strategic sense making bringing

faculty all under one room and giving them a chance to address those three areas that ya has mentioned. So the objective was then to bring out how faculty interprets shifting

expectations, professional authority and institutional responsibility in AI embedded system. So we had this time boxed as you can see over there and you must be wondering

what that means and the rotation uh was intentional. So I will explain what exactly we mean over here with the time box and the rotation prompts. So basically under this compression of uh

this pressure that we put in on participants to respond to the question under that constraint format. There were three countries who participated. So Canada

we have our Indian partners over here from San University Uh Pradesh and then we had our Australian partners from Canterbury Institute of Management. Each group in each country followed the same

kind of uh format. So we had this rotational format which is like each table had prompts like six questions and once the faculty like a group of people from each table they address the prompt

they answer the question and the time boxing over here means that everyone was given 10 minutes to respond to that prompt. Once the 10 minutes were up they get up they move to the next table and

over there then they answer the next prompt. Now there's another additional uh unique thing that we did which is that every table had a noteaker and a facilitator and this was also done

intentionally to capture the ideas while the discussion is going on. We had a noteaker. We had a facilitator because we wanted to make sure that the topic is being addressed and not just you know

people talking about their holidays. So it was under this pressure of time keeping it on task on on topic and then the people the rest of the faculty would get up when it's 10 minutes and then

they would move to the next table whereas the noteaker and the facilitators they stayed on their table. So it was a very unique design that we implemented the format and the structure

was basically I will go back sorry my notes are here. So each group discussed the prompt structured presented two predictable failures. The discussion collapsing into

two level tool level detailing. So we didn't really want to focus on the tool itself but the challenges around it. Second remaining at frustration level without design implications. So when

there's a time constraint people tend to just focus on the more important things that need to be discussed rather than sharing their rent you know just ranting about it or frustrating about it. you

know what the challenges are being uh addressed at the faculty level level. So rotation model then forced crosspollination of perspectives u by distributing ownership of on uh their

insights. Okay. So these were their different categories that I was also addressing. So individual faculty perspective, professional development as a collective

practice and institutional responsibility. So the prompts were organized across these three inter independent levels individual faculty perspective like I mentioned over here

professional development and uh the institutional responsibility and system design. This architecture mirrors the faculty readiness model introduced earlier that I was talking about. AI

integration does not destabilize only individual cap capability. It destabilizes the professional norms and institutional coordination systems. By structuring discussions

across these levels, we could observe where tension achievements and where design intervention becomes absolutely necessary. Okay. So let's look at what questions we

were looking at uh the individual level. So at individual level, faculty were asked project to 2035. How is the nature of faculty work

changing as AI becomes embedded in higher education and what capabilities must intentionally built to perform well in that future? These prompts shift attention from tools to role

transformation. They surface evolving expectations around judgment, oversight, accountability and epistemic authority. Then at the community level, the

professional development piece over here as a collective practice. In practice, how do faculty even build and sustain capability using under ongoing change? By the time they attend a PD session,

you know, after several months, the does not even exist or that technology does not even exist. So there's this constant change occurring. And where does professional development fail? This

reframed professional development as a system, not as a programming. It exposed the difference between episodic exposure and cumulative capabilities. It also surfaced where institutions

unintentionally undermine the very capacity they seek to build. So now let's look at the institutional level. We ask what conditions

must institutions take responsibility for as faculty's role is evolving and what institutional structures currently make it harder for faculty to exercise professional capability.

These questions redirect accountability upward. They move the conversation from faculty need more training. Always we hear this two institutions must we design the

coordinating system the coordination system so across Canada India and Australia we held these prompts constant that consistency was critical. It allows us to interpret convergence not as

coincidence but as structural signal. With that architecture in place, we can now examine what's actually surfaced as national context. All right. So, we're going to look up

and see what we did in Canada and then we're going to go over and see what happened in India, what happened in Australia. So, let's see what we did in Canada, which is our university in uh

Vancouver BC, University of Canada West. and as an educational technologist at the center for teaching excellence um at UCW University Canada West. I work at the intersection uh of faculty

development, instructional design and the emerging technologies. So the Canadian pilot offered a valuable opportunity to observe how AI integration is unfolding not only in

theory but in everyday teaching practice. So a little bit about UCW, University Canada West. It has 254 faculty across two schools and more than 30 uh course

families with frequent cross school teaching. So we operate within British Columbia uh within British Columbia's quality framework uh assurance quality assurance framework and our hybrid

delivery model was established before the widespread AI adoption. So this con context matters and AI is entering this ecosystem uh that was not originally designed for constant human AI

interaction. So faculty are now navigating their way uh AI within existing assessment structures, curriculum change, workload expectations and academic integrity policies that uh

predate generative systems. From the perspective of the center for teaching excellence at UCW, we've seen rapid faculty interest in AI related programming. So there's sudden interest

in you know looking into uh learning more about their engagement has grown uh organically often driven by immediate classroom challenges constant challenges that they're facing at uh daily basis on

daily basis they want to kind of address those challenges rather than institutional mandates. So this creates both innovation but at the same time unevenness.

So here are some pictures at our workshop that we uh conducted. Aya is in the background and you can see our partners on the screen who had joined us online. So they were there to observe

what we're doing in our context. Then when they did it, we were there to observe virtually what they were how they're implementing it. So we did this like basically three times.

That's Sandra and another picture over here. So you will notice that every table over here. Yeah, I can see. So you will see here that every table has these uh laptop a

person sitting with a laptop who's taking notes and there's one person who's meditating and then that's our faculty interacting with the prompt that is on table.

A more overview of this workshop. So you can see there are six tables set up. Each table had a different prompt under those three categories. You can also see the

timer going on in the on the screen. So there was 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, people had to get up, move to the next table. So a quick uh [laughter]

I can lower the volume. But what becomes visible in the workshop was was not really the technological anxiety. It was professional calibration. Faculty were rethinking uh what it means to actually

design assign uh assignments, evaluate uh student work and model responsible AI use often independently within their own courses. So the challenge is not really their willingness, it is the alignment.

So you can see that the timer was up and The moment the timer was done, people started getting up and moving around to the next table. Right, let's move to the next slide.

Now, what we actually got out of those discussions, those workshops. So, these are our faculty insights. So, three insights stood out. Again, at the individual level, faculty emphasize

evaluative judgment. They were less concerned with generative AI outputs and more concerned with distinguishing credible reasoning from hallucination bias and surface fluency.

So at the collective level then there was the strong demand for uh shared clarity. Faculty asked for discipline relevant guidance on responsible AI use not rigid

rules but defensible boundaries that allow professional judgment to recognize uh and be recognized and supported at the institutional level. Assessment re redesign uh was something that surfaced

repeatedly. Faculty recognized that traditional assessment models are under pressure but they uncertainty about how to recalibrate expectations consistently

across programs. From a faculty development perspective, this signals that the pressure is not technical, but it's structural. Now, out of those three, we then have a

strategic implication for our institution. First, AI capability must be embedded in ongoing professional learning not addressed through isolated workshops. Faculty need structured

opportunities to experiment, reflect and recalibrate judgment within their disciplines. Second, institutional guidance must move beyond general statements.

Clarity around AI use and academic integrity must be coherent enough to reduce ambiguity without constraining pedag pedagogical uh autonomy. Third, if AI literacy

is becoming a core faculty competency, then institutions must recognize it accordingly in workload planning, evaluating systems and long strategic long-term strategic

priorities from the vantage point of the center for teaching excellence. The Canadian pilot demonstrated that AI integration is fundamentally about supporting faculty in a period of

structural transition and as you will see in the broader synthesis across all these different countries these patterns actually extend beyond one institutional context and with that I will pass it on

to now we are going to see uh what took place in the Indian context and I would like to invite Dr. Professor Ti Singh Thank you SA

distinguished delegates, colleagues, policy makers and all attendees here with profound uh height I have stand here as a provice chancellor of one of India's reputed

university Chundigur. University of Pradesh. It's enough to say that we are NRF ranked 19 across India and we have expanded our wings to

Uttar Pradesh specifically in Lacno. So I'm representing here very profoundly a newborn university over there but the roots are very deep. This university is truly a multi-disiplinary university

just to set the context. We do have to begin with 150 faculty colleagues, 40 different programs around 2,700 students

on campus and those programs are really multi-disiplinary in nature. These are from law to liberal arts to engineering to management to computing and so on so

forth. I forgot to include pharmacy as well. So what Sana told the same design was adopted at Chundigar University of Pradesh to discuss the faculty futures down the line a decade 10 years how it

would be and what came out from there I would be narrating rather than going towards the slides before going to the slides before narrating that I wish to show you some

of the quick pictures as a protocol that the same thing has happened or replicated ated what was done at University Canada West. So there was the table structure laid down everybody was

there sitting take one noteaker was there one facilitator was there and so on so forth. Now I quickly will come that how around those three things what Sana uh briefed you in the beginning

that what actually came out from the entire discussion of roughly 100 uh participants who were there involved directly or indirectly. Artificial intelligence is no longer an

emerging trend that we all know. It is rapidly becoming embedded into the academic blood stream of any university, any higher educational institution across disciplines. In fact, the shift

is already visible. Take it forensic sciences. I I include to uh I forgot to include the name of forensic science. We are running for courses in forensic science. Include for forensic sciences,

include healthcare, include management domain. We can think of AI is there. Somewhere with very profound handshake, somewhere with certain reservations. Reservations like in the field of

judiciary there is a emotional intelligence or contextual interpretation and moral discriminant that cannot be automated. This thing is is still prevailing in the judiciary uh

domain. if we want to integrate AI into them. So these domain specific examples which I have taken collectively underscore a larger truth and which came out from those discussions. AI is

transformative but it is not so. This brings a central uh question of transforming the faculty who would be dealing with the next generation and passing the passing the integration of

AI into various domains. By 2035 what was observed faculty members will not simply deliver lectures or supervise research. They will become curators of knowledge. all know nothing

nothing uh new but in the in the in in new era and that era is algorithmic era critical validators of AI generated insights. So this was also another very wonderful point which came out

designers of human AI collaborations and ethical stewards. Now the traditional model of knowledge transmits uh transmission is giving way a more

complex responsibility ensuring that intelligence whether human or artificial is accurate contextualized ethical and socially meaningful.

However, this evolution demands intentional capability building and that cap capability building we talked during those roundts that how those capability buildings must go down the line a

decades time. First and foremost thing which came up is that domain expertise becomes even more critical in the AI age. AI is not only one thing which will do everything. So domain expertise is

first thing which came out from the discussion. Second thing new literacies are emerging analytical thinking, data literacy, ba basic programming awareness, mathematical reasoning and

interdisciplinary curioity. These things faculty wants that they should inculcate and that those must be the central point while faculty is teaching to the next generation. Thirdly is lifelong learning

is no longer aspirational. In fact it is structural now. So aspirations was was passed now structural is the future. But alongside this all capability

building what was observed that the ethical complexities must be confronted. The guiding principle must there be human in loop governance. AI should augment human capability. It not should

not replace the responsibility. Human responsibility. Faculty must model ethical use. What was observed by the faculty verifying outputs, attributing sources and ensuring transparencies.

Yet we must acknowledge an uncomfortable truth. Faculty professional development often fails not because educators resist change but because system constraint them and this a big point which came out

from the discussions system constraint so systems need to be faculty where the system and here come the institution what Sana was talking about here comes the institution where

where their role start more prominently Many institution remain semi-digital. Now in the name of digital they are semi-digital. They become knowledge systems are

fragmented and unstructured. This was again an observation among the faculty members. Infrastructure gap limits the access to computational capabilities, computational infrastructure and so on

so forth. But they are the faculties are overburdened with the administrative and all other type of works. That was a wonderful observation and one one almost everybody uh uh put it on record. So

institutions must take deliberate actions in five areas. One is infrastructure uh enab uh enablement that was observed. Second is mandated and structured training that was again

observed. Third is workload rationalization. Fourth is pedagogical transformation. And the last one is ethical and governance frameworks. Everywhere AI will be a facilitator. We

must also guard against what we may be term intellectual delegation by default. Unconscious outsourcing of thinking to machines. This is a very unconsciously what we are

doing. uh faculty observed that unconsciously the next generation is outsourcing the thinking to machines and that has to be stopped and that has to be somehow brought in to the uh teaching

pedagogies looking for towards 2035 I'm just summing up the future of faculty work is not defined by technological displacement but by cognitive elevation the successful faculty member of the

future what was observed by all Our participants will be deeply rooted in disciplinary scholarship, technological fluent but critically

vigilant, ethically grounded and socially responsive, interdisciplinary in outlook and committed to lifelong intellectual

renewals. untimely. The age of AI calls us not to surrender our humanity but to refine it. Let us go hand in hand. That was another very strong

observation from all the faculty. So artificial intelligence I conclude artificial intelligence can accelerate so many things. May it be discovery, may it be enhance, may it be precisen in in

doing the works and democratizing access to knowledge but wisdom, empathy, moral judgment and contextual understanding remain. Human capacities and faculty wants that these must be with them.

These must be retained with them. The future of higher education will not be written by algorith only. It will be co-authored by visionary institutions likes of us,

empowered faculty likes the one who participated, responsible governance and ethically guided intelligence. If we act with intentionally today, this is possible. That's all from my side. In in

next 30 seconds, Dr. Amit Mishra will conclude the last three points. Uh thank you sir. Although I am having only 30 seconds but here I would like to highlight one important point. Uh the

conclusions which you are drawing here that is not only limited to the engineering background. Basically we had the 38 person from all diversity. You know few of them were from the medical

field few of them were from the engineering background few of them were from the government background they were also political uh background. Even though some industry peoples all 38

peoples came together and they drawn a few conclusions whatever the Dr. PPC has been discussed on the basis of that we have uh here few of the recommendation for the institution in the Indian

prospective. So the recommendations are going to conclude in a three important points and the first point which we are covering the first uh uh uh recommendation which we are g giving for

the institution that is build institutional AI infrastructure and the training which include provide access to the AI tools GPU and dedicated labs which we have in a Chandigar University

Uttar Pradesh offer essential skill programs such as prompt engineering and the AI tool train uh tool training encourage experimentation with a strong emphasis on The human oversight helps

faculty stay ahead of the AI advancement and a close skill loops. And the second recommendation which we we have we are going to uh suggest here that is what the promote uh uh

I think uh the next slide sorry. So the second recommendation which we are giving here that is to promote the ethical and human in the loop while using the AI and uh which include the

position AI as a support tool not as a replacement for the educator require faculty to verify AI outputs using the domain expertise reinforcement uh ethics to prevent flagism biasness

misinformation and the over resilience and the last recommendation which we are suggesting to the Indian institutions are that is overcome barriers through the strategic ecosystem which includes

the resolve limitations like semidigital system and the fragmented knowledge. It also include the develop real world outcome based EI labs integrated AI literacy in the curriculum which we are

also having as I'm saying that the Digar University Uttar Pradesh is a AI augmented university. So in all the curriculum we are including the AI in a syllabus even though in the last I'm

going to share the recommendation that is provide the workload relief. Even though Canada people are also saying the same thing really provide the workload relief to support the continuous

learning and the innovation. So it's all from the Indian perspective. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; So thank you Professor Singh and thank you. So what I'd like to do now is

to move to our colleagues in in Australia who have played also a very important role in bringing this idea to life. Unfortunately though our colleagues could not join us here in

India but they did prepare video to share with us and I'm hoping that we will understand their operating context as the faculty futures workshops had moved to Australia.

Canterbury Institute of Management is one of the leading private education based in Australia in higher education. So our unique con we have we offer degrees in undergraduate, post-graduates

and at the research degrees at the master's level. Our unique context is that we are professionally oriented. Our curriculum, our degrees are professionally oriented and industry

aligned practice where our faculty has a equal combination of industry based and academic with the PhD holders on the master degrees but majority of our academic staff or PhD holders. So we

have mix of academic and industry experience faculty who are training our grad our students in undergraduate and MBA levels to be at least job ready when they graduate with the degree. So the

growing interest of AI integration we have witnessed our among our family of our facult our faculty family over here at CIM and considering those one CIM is proactively

uh organizing different workshops seminars and field collaborations and guest speakers from industry as well as from the higher education public universities here in Australia or

worldwide to for to consider for the faculty development of the CIM. them. So our key motive is that that our faculty should be able to collaborate with the other other academia other faculty and

industry experts so that they can meaningfully integrate AI into the curriculum and a pedagogy at CIM. So as the best example of that one is So best example of that one is that when

we recently organized a third workshop of the series in collaboration with University Canada West and Chundigar University Uttar Pradesh under the affiliation of AI India Summit, India

impact summit. from it. So the key design and the structure of the workshop were the same as designed by university west and followed by the two other institutes. So six promps and the tables

with the six tables with the participant and discussion was around those six promps. The key insight that has developed from those insight is that the shift of the all faculty development

should be more focused towards the faculty development on the capabilities their judge and their ethical how they can use the AI ethically. How they can integrate

AI into the curriculum from the pedagogy perspective rather than the teaching and learning perspective rather than considering AI as a tool. And the key focus should not be trained you know

faculty in the way that they consider AI as a tool. So the emphasis was also on the redesigned assessment and to enable meaningful and responsible use of AI so that AI our faculty is confident with a

strong ethical and pedagogical judgment when they integrate AI into their curriculums over here and the the key focus was also that emerged from the discussion as part of the workshop was

that there should be a leadership and there the AI should be integrated into the coareness and policy should be around that one so that they have that leadership that can guide them to

develop those skills and capabilities to for sustainable AI adoption in in the next 10 year. The strategic vision where a where CIMC itself and the AI is that we want our key focus is to

develop a AI AI forward learning ecosystem where we position ourself to embed AI into the curriculum into the assessment into the research and at the same time involving different

stakeholders industry engagement and the other group partners from the other higher education based in Australia and based in other countries for that one and invest continuously in AI focused

professional development that can lead to the paragogy innovation and leadership capacities to ensure the sustainable transformation in the next 10 year. We also see ourself

working on developing an ethical framework and a strong AI based awareness that and our policies that provide a secure tool and technology that is related to AI for our faculty

development and ensuring that academic integrity is not only happening at the part of that uh student level only but when it's a when it comes to collaboration for the research it should

be seen as a key importance in the faculty faculty development as well. So since we are our majority of the students are over here international our academic academics are from different

different ethnic and cultural and language backgrounds. So we also see ourself considering equity and inclusion when integrating AI at any level of our whether it's a pedagogy whether it's

just for the you know for our graduate employability. So that will be considered as a key part of uh our strategic vision that we see ourself in attain

of time. I'm going to understand. So, first of all, I want to thank you for your patience. Um there was a lot of information that was shared today and I think what is important is

that we share the learnings of those three pre-conference workshops and what I hope to do is to give you the cliff notes essentially what has happened here is that Canada,

Australia and India clearly operate under different regulatory regimes, different scales, different policy pressures and yet the faculty in all three countries basically described what

AI is doing inside their institutions and that this convergence is deeply structural. So that is a very important takeaway from today's conversation as well. These are not three isolated

national stories about a new tool. In fact, it is a shared reconfiguration of academic work and I believe that's a fundamental lesson that has been learned from these dialogues across India,

Canada as well as Australia. And fundamentally here this reconfiguration of academic work is about how this is produced as well as evaluated and governed. And so this divergence is the

basis for a road map that is emerging and what I would like to do is to move towards what this global road map looks like. So basically the idea of a global road

map is emerging which fundamentally does not mean universal policy but rather it means a template that will be exported across different systems and it cannot be a finished blueprint. It has to be

unfinished. So it is an emerging design that is architecturally grounded in convergence as well as refined through continued cross context texting. And so what I hope to do now is that as we

continue these global dialogues, we will expand further in these three countries and beyond. And it is a wonderful opportunity to share these insights at this particular summit. And I thank you

for your time.
