## 📝 Transcript

And we're joined also by Mr. Neil Kant Wanker German VP and global head of cloud AI and edge business Tata communications leading cloud AI and edge adoption globally.

Before we start the conversation, I request the startup founders uh joining us for the next segment also on stage to have a to have a group photo. Uh we also need u on stage right now Mr.

Savv Bandupad, Mr. Aindra Kumar and Mr. Rohitash uh Dave Sharma. If you can have the startup founders joining us for the next segment also on stage for a quick group photo please.

We have Mr. Ainda Kumar, Mr. Rohit D Sharma and Mr. Sor Bandup. All right. I just &gt;&gt; Thank you everyone and uh I request the

startup founders to rejoin us after the panel discussion. Thank you so much. We'll start the panel. &gt;&gt; Good morning everyone. Uh I request you to please take up your seats.

Okay. U so under India AI mission we are focusing on uh data sovereignity infrastructure sovereignity and model sovereignity and uh we are trying to see if we can

have this DPI kind of moment uh with AI and to discuss all of these we have these interesting panels or you know learned panel uh with me uh we are also going to focus on the sovereignity part

because that's the theme of the session So without wasting any time uh I want to ask questions to my panel members but here is the here is the uh you know the guideline or maybe the context for all

of you. So I will start with one common question to all of my panel members and after that I will ask one question uh to each of them and if time permits we can take one question from the audience.

This is how we are going to conduct the session. So to start with uh let me ask uh the common question to all of you. what is sovereignity as per your perspective and uh maybe Tarun you can

start from. &gt;&gt; Sure. Uh thanks Amit. Uh thank you uh for giving me this opportunity. This is Tarun from E2 networks. Uh so sovereignity like according to me is all

about intent. So uh so sovereignity is not a checklist that okay we did data localization check. We did hardware which is located in India check. So it's about the intent like what's how do we

uh intend to remain in control of our destiny. So which means that every nuanced decision we take about our compute stack has to be seen from the lens of sovereignity. So like where

intentionality is very important. So one is data localization. Second is whether the data centers themselves are owned by Indian entities which means that there is no foreign influence on our data

centers per se. From a hardware perspective, as of today, we don't have much of a choice but to go with the best hardware that the world has to offer us. And it's very very hard to dealink from

the hardware supply chain. Now uh third piece is that like uh apart from data and compute localization in a Indian entity like is your cloud operator Indian and are they dependent is your

cloud operator dependent on software uh which is coming from outside India or they have ownership of software by way of uh their expertise into open source and uh being able to operate the whole

cloud without any interference from outside. So that's like I think the final piece of the puzzle till the infrastructure layer. Now increasingly in sovereign AI models are becoming a

part of infrastructure itself. So where the model builders are working very closely with infrastructure providers. So I think that's the fifth pillar of sovereignity. So ultimately all of these

have to be there and at every layer of the stack that any organization chooses the intentionality has to be there that like look I want to be as independent as possible as in control of my destiny as

possible and uh my destiny is obviously linked to the destiny of my country. So I think like what we have been lacking is that from a uh if you look at like some of the countries in the east uh

Japan comes to our mind like basically the intentionality of sovereignity has been very strong uh in many of these societies. So I think that is something that we have been lacking in India uh

somewhat lacking in India. I'm not saying completely lacking and I think like over last couple of years uh with the global events that has drastically changed. So looking forward to more

views from my colleagues. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Talking of sovereign intelligence, it really uh as Tarun rightly put it. There are several aspects to it. One of the

key areas where we need to scale up in India would be on the hardware front where we need access to heterogeneous hardware. Sovereignty means you're not tied up to one or other type of

hardware. It means that a developer or a researcher in an institute or university in India can has the choice of running his workload on the right hardware for that for that workload. And second is

energy efficiency and sustainability. For us to scale this to huge data centers, lots of compute available to the entire AI community here, we need to make sure that we have energy

efficient hardware. Uh that we have the power, energy, cooling infrastructure that goes into developing data centers. And third, ease of access in terms of programmability.

A developer or an enterprise should be able to use standardized APIs, programming models that are common and not have to program for any particular hardware. So that choice should be on

the developer to use which uh whichever workload he wants with least effort to translate it across hardware. So that is an important aspect of sovereignty. And the fourth would be to be ready for all

cutting edge workloads. For example, for the kind of inferencing applications that you see now, multi- aent workflows, it requires a huge amount of token processing.

It means that you need almost realtime inferencing speeds. So making sure that our compute infrastructure can provide such inferencing speeds for us to scale and build businesses on agentic

workflows would be important. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um thanks a lot um Amit for the question and uh just doubling down on on what uh Tarun said but before that quick introduction my name is Neil. I head the

global cloud AI and edge business for Tata communications. uh and uh thanks a lot for having me here. Um so sovereignity in one word if I can describe it's it's to ensure that

you don't have a kill switch with somebody else who can turn off the knob and you have uh you have no access to your models to your data to the compute to your data center where your compute

and uh data is residing. So, so the ability to avoid somebody else controlling your destiny as Tarun said and have the destiny in your hands and it starts at every layer and uh so the

full sovereignty means that every layer which is the passive infrastructure layer which is the data center coloss power uh then the compute infrastructure the cloud management platform and within

the management platform itself uh I think sometime we forget that uh while data could be residing in India the control plane the orchestration and the provisioning mechanism could still be

outside the country. So the ability to have the entire cloud management platform also within the sovereign borders and then uh the meta data uh which is residing over the data the data

of the data should also be within the country. So sometimes we also forget the user data could be outside the country while the raw data uh the native data could be in the country. And then last

but not the least the application and the uh model the application the use case layer itself. So the entire stack should be in India. So we do have some challenges in some parts but I think

overall we are moving uh in the uh direction of getting full sovereignity. So to some extent I would say we have with Indian cloud providers uh uh we have avoided a situation where we can

have the kill switch out outside the country even in the software layer we've moved a lot the from a management platform a lot to open source whether it's OpenStack based cloud whether it's

Kubernetes based uh clusters where it's open source you can't really kill it overnight and avoid proprietary software so that helps us move up the I call the sovereignity ladder I if you will so

that's for me uh sovereignity &gt;&gt; yeah thanks so much and I think what we understood that this is not only about data models and compute this is also about design discipline and development

as well overall now uh uh let me move ahead with the discussion further my question is uh to Lakshmi so Lakshmi as demand for frontier AI scale continues continues to grow. Now compute is

beginning to be a strategic uh from your perspective what would be a AI digital public infrastructure looks like in practice and uh if you can discuss about you know the heterogeneous

hardware concept as well because you know if we think from a homogeneous hardware perspective we are limiting ourself. So heterogeneous hardware is also something that we should opt for

and discuss. So I just wanted to listen your opinion on that. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, as you rightly said, locking ourselves into one type of hardware uh

is not really sovereign. So you're actually overdependent on one type. So there should be uh enough of infrastructure consisting of different types of

hardware. uh as I said fast inferencing workflows which are required to scale this and be a truly sovereign AI uh ecosystem needs almost real time inferencing.

We need easy programmability. We need PyTorch or ML or standard compilers to be used. We need standard APIs to be used by application developers. If these are there combined with data

security and sovereignty and the ability to scale clusters, the ability to scale data centers should be easy from an operational and technical standpoint. In addition to this, if you have energy

efficient hardware that can actually uh produce better results with less power with the right level of cooling and other infrastructure that would make us really solid.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much Lakshmi. And uh now just building on that Tarun uh if I may ask you from a perspective of India AI compute provider. So what is the single biggest bottleneck that you see

specifically on the scaling domestic AI cloud today and uh which constraint most directly impact or maybe impact the sovereignity in practice like you can talk about capital power network talent

policy etc. See I think uh majorly uh when we look at uh the kind of compute sizes that are being announced globally compared to that like uh till now India has shown up

to be slightly behind the curve but I think that is very very rapidly changing. So where now capital availability although it was constrained in the past we have seen that

increasingly it is becoming more and more available for putting up more compute uh policy support has been really great uh over lastuh uh year or so or even before that from the

government to set up more compute infrastructure with uh good policies around data center and uh especially a very very clear-cut uh taxation policy around that like uh uh how to attract

the global uh cloud computing to kind of make make India one of the key base. So I think like overall uh I don't feel as of today we are constrained like I think all the constraints are constraints of

the past. I think we should be able to build like a lot of uh AI compute capacity very very rapidly in India now. So uh that's that's my view. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh so Neil contend this is to you.

Um connectivity is often the invisible layer of AI sovereignity right and how should India and global south economies think about integrating network cloud and edge. So AI infrastructure reaches

population scale beyond major cities while remaining secure and interoperable. I think [laughter] there are multiple questions. I hope the audience got the

question. So we talked about India, we talked about global south, we talked about tier 2, tier three cities, we talked about network. Um so let me try and um make sense out of this question

and um impress upon the audience. So one is of course network uh is super important. I think um we often forget that uh network is the glue, the invisible layer

which carries data between the clouds between the user and the and the compute. In this case, you know, if you're inferencing models uh uh then of course the users are accessing

uh uh and the models and the inference endpoints could be in a local compute, it could be in a core data center uh in a centralized cloud. So networks are very very important and latency is a big

factor. U so therefore uh networks are super important and networks are pretty interdependent. So in that sense I'm I'm weaving in the global south as well. Um uh you know networks are carried across

the country through subc cables which Tata communications has and therefore the ability to actually uh now I'm waving the third part which is uh the AI interdependence right. So I think it

would be very narrow-minded to just say that okay we want to be completely sovereign and shut our borders to anything from outside and specifically in the context of global south given

that we want to take a we want to take a leadership position amongst at least the global south and foster lot of collaboration and therefore um I would reckon that uh we need to look at um

some sort of u uh differential privacy if you will You know it's a difficult concept to understand. We know absolute privacy but there's something called the differential privacy where certain parts

of the data can be applied. You can have absolute privacy and certain parts can be shared. So let me give you an example for example we are very big in agriculture right as a and uh even

healthcare right so we have citizen scale 1.5 billion kind of population and uh 60% of the population is on agriculture. So we can use the local agri data to produce agrich models and

agri use cases and then u keep the data local but take the weights out of the model and give it to the and and cooperate with the global south and similarly on healthcare we can do that

and then u uh so have a very uh what what I call as a federated cooperation amongst the global south uh so data stays local I'm not advocating that we should share our data with outside the

borders. But you can have a mechanism to do federated training uh to apply differential uh uh privacy policies and create a collaborative uh mechanism between the global south so that all the

other countries who are part of the global south can also benefit uh from the advancement of uh in AI which India is now I think uh cheerleading right uh in a in a sense. So um uh so overall I

think uh networks uh the way we have developed our networks we have made sure that we can give access to low latency uh compute and inferencing. Uh we are also now advancing the concept of uh

scaled low latency inferencing through edge compute. uh by taking compute closer to the population to to the citizens and to enterprise users by having edge compute pops where we can

have distributed GPU and uh do this u inferencing of small action models and small small language models with footprints less than two billion parameters and can help uh you know this

aggregate tech use cases healthcare use cases and industry 4 auto use cases for manufacturing etc. So a combination of these will help us foster I think advancement of AI amongst the global

south and the ability to take AI deep into the uh you know the tier one, tier two and tier three cities and not only restricted to the tier uh the metro cities.

&gt;&gt; I think you you talked about federated learning an interesting concept you know most of us work on decentralized federated learning kind of system. Still we are seeing some research and progress

around the centralized federated learning that could be interesting to see how it unfolds. Uh just one follow-up question you talked about you know u edge like inferencing edge. So

how do you see this 6G is going to help uh you know at least countries like India because we are still you know evolving into this phase. &gt;&gt; Sorry uh

&gt;&gt; 6G at age for &gt;&gt; okay you're talking about 6G. Yeah, because you know we have to deal with videos uh as well not only images or you know uh

&gt;&gt; no 6G is definitely going to uh help us u u so as as of now I think uh from an edge computing point of view we uh we have two ways to access uh edge compute fixed line networks for for sure but uh

5G is fast uh being used for driving uh the connectivity for edge compute and 6G is going to be really a gamecher because even now uh even in 5G with uh uh we are getting sub 10 millisecond latency but

it is not it's not robust enough for us uh especially if you're getting into uh robotic surgery those kind of use cases right and very high speeded gaming kind

of thing so 60 is definitely going to help and it's going to be more stable it's going to be more cost effective we know 5G is expensive 6G I believe is more optimized on cost.

So so apart from the ability to provide us uh a better network throughput and a stable uh ultra low latency connectivity and high reliable connectivity it's also going to be an ROI. 5G we know it

suffers from a ROI challenge. Uh so 6G is definitely going to help. &gt;&gt; Thanks so much Lakmi. Do you want to talk about Okay. Uh so uh let me just ask one more

question to each of the panel member. You know a common question related to the single most important infrastructure decision that India can take in next one or two year that you feel is very

important for the sovereign AI in the country like a common question for all of you like what do you feel? &gt;&gt; Sure. I think uh uh in a way like uh energy might be the most important thing

for compute today. So like having an ability to generate like uh power locally within the same campus as the where the data centers are. So either through a nuclear SMR or BSR which is

the Indian standard uh could be like which is already being in done in place could be the most important decision for India to for the energy for compute especially if you look at like 10 GW

added to the grid uh it's going to be like a lot of infrastructure that will need to be added for that on the other hand having local power which can even replace the generators because nuclear

power can potentially run at a highly reliable 8 year 10 year time scale where you don't need to turn it off and you just need battery energy storage systems,

nuclear power onsite uh right next to a data center park. So that could be something very important for the future of sovereign computing India. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

Um speak Lakshmi. Yeah, building on what Tarun just said about energy availability, assuming that you have these huge grids supplying power to the

data centers, the next step would be to actually have the ecosystem that can build data centers at scale and be able to operate and maintain it for all the heterogeneous hardware that you would

have on it. That will be key to making it available as a sovereign AI infrastructure to all those different types of users who would want access to it.

&gt;&gt; So much continue. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I u while sustainable power power nuclear power is um well taken uh I would also add access to risk capital. Uh I think um while u India emission is

uh you know we have to continue doing that given that uh access to compute uh uh you know which is available at price points which can be afforded and you can build and innovate on top of it is

absolutely important but also you know uh access to risk capital we don't have the the depth in the risk capital market whether through VCs or private equities in India as of Now uh whatever we be

seeing right now is on the data center side which is good but we need access to risk capital uh that will foster that will you know put uh innovation on the AI side on steroids uh while data center

is attracting attention which is very very important because that's a uh foundational input to u the entire uh AI uh innovation uh but very soon we'll find that we you know we we not able

scale these small startups because they don't have the access to risk capital for them to scale and innovate and catch up. &gt;&gt; Understood. Any thoughts around like

this is for all of you like how quantum can change you know the energy efficient part of the work or maybe the kind of uh you know future we see for India from an AI perspective.

&gt;&gt; Sure. So I think like the uh integration of quantum with the uh current HPC platforms on GPUs are uh something that needs to be uh a focus area for India especially as quantum is the compute of

the future. So I think like we are looking at like anywhere between a scale of 5 to 10 years where quantum computing will become a very very important part of the overall comput ecosystem. So I do

believe that CPU will continue to exist, GPU will continue to exist, QPUs would get added to it. So QPUs would have like certain workloads that are very very specific from a security uh

cryptographic standpoint that would be very very helpful to add. &gt;&gt; Um Laxshmi maybe you can talk about this as well but in case if you also want to touch base on AI supercomputers in case

if it's something of your interest. I think &gt;&gt; uh I think while quantum computing is taking off and it's encouraging to see a lot of it coming to life, we're still

very far away from making it viable through the right software infrastructure programming to actually uh get it to a point where people can use it. In addition to that, we also

need to solve the problems of security and other specific problems uh which will be thrown open again when quantum computing comes in. Much of the sec security infrastructure today can

break when the real quantum computing is enabled on large scale. So solving some of these problems to me is quintessential to making quantum available and viable.

I don't have much inputs on quantum yet. We closely looking at the space and I think both Tarun and Laxmi talked about the security challenges um with the quantum. Um I'm not sure whether

from a uh you know beyond the research uh labs it's available for uh deployments uh in in a uh in an enterprise context yet uh the use cases are uh even now uh restricted to the

security side uh so we closely watching the space that's what I can say uh beyond that uh still looks like some time away but maybe we'll see as Taron is saying QPUs very soon in the data

centers how soon it is is out there I'm not able to speculate on it &gt;&gt; that's interesting and in fact from shabernet perspective quantum is very important for the country as well if we

see by the way please visit Fujitsu both we have a quantum mockup there for 60 64 cubit system so we have put it there uh I think we have a time for one question if somebody's interested to ask uh you

know to our panel members we can take one question okay okay uh okay I think uh we can conclude the session what we understood that uh

&gt;&gt; okay please ask yeah please No no no please. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh this is a question which um relates to

an AI convention like in Chile we have in public international domain we have the United Nations law of the sea convention which brought the whole world together. So everybody were going

randomly all over the place. So there were different sea treaties and different conventions which brought everybody together and it created a constitution of the oceans where after

different bodies of the UN they have their own respective places to play. Now when we look at AI, it looks like the ocean by itself and a very deep and a very

dangerous one and we are all coming up with so many different countries are coming up with so many different kind of um you know creations, renovations and let's just call it products and

competence. Where does it all integrate? [snorts] How will this unify? Now she just spoke about quantum and you know we are talking about supercomputers we're talking about cables we're talking about

crossber you know we are how how does how do we bring everything into one responsible AI convention where the globe takes responsibility for everybody &gt;&gt; sorry I think that's a very pertinent

question thank you for the question uh we obviously don't have the answer but I think what will be required is a multid-disciplinary multi-country initiative where all sectors are

represented which can put responsible and ethical AI guard rails on what are provided publicly which is there in parts every company offering AI puts its own guardrails on

its models but I think uh at a global level we don't have standards or conventions And I think eventually that will be needed with the pace at which the

innovations here are happening. &gt;&gt; Yes. So company has their own way of dealing with AI. They have their own guardrails and they are most of the companies are now establishing ethics

and governance office for secure and safe deployment for AI. Now a common global guideline that is still you know not in place. There are some fundamentals that people follow but if

you want to fit everything in one framework it's very difficult for now. this is what we are seeing. So I think with with these words we can conclude the session and thank you so much for

you know part of the session and thank you so much all of you to listening us patiently. Yeah &gt;&gt; thank you everyone. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Amit and uh thank you

to all our panelists. &gt;&gt; Thank you everyone. &gt;&gt; We can now begin with segment two. Um and I'll request the panelists to uh come back for the group photo at the end

of the uh session. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Segment two is a startup showcase where we'll hear from startups building cutting edge AI solutions from India for India and for the global south. Uh our

first speaker is Sorav Bandupad uh founder and chief scientist of Shuna Labs. I'm huddi.

foreign. Thank you so much. My name is Sar of Gandhi. So whatever you are seeing uh we can uh still keep playing the sound a bit. Uh so here we are launching 55

Indian languages uh uh realtime translation model. All the TTSS are uh inhouse built. Uh the translation model is a very small model. It's a 1.3 billion parameter model. Uh along with

NASCOM we are putting it uh in the open weights domain. um we have languages wherein there was absolutely no coverage. So data availability accessibility was a major issue. So this

is the first model that we are kind of launching from India and on the uh continuing from the previous panel discussion we were talking about compute. Yes, compute is extremely

important but we have to bring in innovation as well like you know whatever little compute that we have I mean we have developed it with four GPUs uh for that matter. Uh so this is for

the public services and you can see all those Indian languages being written being spoken. We can just increase the voice a bit. Uh can can we increase the sound a bit?

Fore! Foreign! Foreign! vi for [music]

We are Indians. Our diversity is our identity. Okay. So here is the uh official launch and yes we do support Sanskrit as well. So it's one of the most difficult

language to translate and in a 1.3 billion parameter model you have all of it. Uh it is out in open open sourced um it it was a challenge right you know no one talks about the longtail data set.

Uh here we are talking about a technology halves and have nots. U I never believe AI is going to replace any human being for that matter. It's people with AI who are going to replace people

without AI. In that scenario, if we do not support everyone in their language, if the supports are not available in the longtail languages, we are talking about a design on which we are planning to

have you know the AI halves and have not divides. And this is where also I would like to thank Google and Google Vani project wherein they have gone to the local geographies and individual

districts to collect that data. I would like to thank NASCOM because otherwise you know a small startup like us uh for us to take a global ambition would have would not have been possible. Last but

not the least yes we have broken all the world records in terms of ASR. I'm not a big fan of ASR. Uh uh sorry I'm a big fan of ASR. I'm not a big fan on word error rate to be a metric of ASR but our

Pingala V1 has uh the lowest world error word error rate uh across uh uh uh every possible languages globally there we support 204 languages that's also open model you can go and check it in hugging

face things are verifiable and we are talking about open ASL leaderboard ranking so thank you so much I will uh if you have any questions I'll take uh questions from you or otherwise Uh here

is the launch. You can download the QR and we we officially launch it. Any questions for me? [applause] &gt;&gt; So what's your business model as in

you've out you've open source everything it's on hugging face open weight. So what &gt;&gt; okay so business model business what do you want to do now? Exactly. We okay so

there is a um you know um we have three tier or rather two-tier approach so we have large model providers they just provide horizontal generic models and then we have few players who are just

rappers or I I have a massive respect for rappers but you have players who provide fine-tuning over the existing model problem is we need verticalized model development here we are showing

the whole model was developed in less than 40 GPU hours of training We are talking about a new market wherein we are talking about custom models for every individual that will be sovereign

that you can host it and at your place. You don't have to pay the token tax of a big model and it will outperform any uh major models which is horizontal in nature. So we are creating a space

wherein we are talking about a custom model development for your use case for your age or you know uh your own premise or devices. So yes uh we are uh showing the capability few things we are not

doing for uh for profit like this it's for the society for but for profit we create custom models from scratch and we take just 40 GPUs on an average to kind of develop a model so this is a

different way of looking at things any other questions times. Okay, thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Savv. Uh, next we have Ravindra Kumar, founder and CEO of

Technode uh 8. And um I I would uh request to be within the time limit of 5 minutes each. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hello. Good afternoon. Can we pause the video please? Let me

introduce first what we are trying to do here. Thank you. Thank you Sudep. So Sor was mentioning that uh my name is Ravindra. I'm founder of Technodate. Uh Sor was mentioning that AI will not

replace people. I almost feel bad mostly on this occasion because probably we should discuss after what we are trying to do here. So I come from a background. I worked with a company I would not like

to name it but that company achieved 100% automation in their own factories way back in 2012 complete factory uh zero workforce working on full capacity now that is the

world we are headed to why we need to do that in India uh even if today you visit any shop floor you'll find most of the manufacturers struggling to find workforce and we are competing against

some of the best out there in the world to sustain our manufacturing. Now to sustain manufacturing automation is a need. People need to automate their factories. But the problem is how do you

even conceptualize build and deploy the automation solution. So that is something which we want to democratize for everyone. Technodate AI we are building a co-pilot

primarily to make industrial automation and engineering as easy as DIY. So uh there are three module in engineering life cycle. Generally speaking there are three phases the concept design phase

the deployment phase and then eventually there is the uh troubleshooting phase where you fix the machines. So in our copilot we will have generally three uh modules for each of these phases. Uh,

can we please play the video? There's some music, entertaining music. Yeah, thank you. So generally what happens is when you have to build any automation or robotic

solution the knowhow becomes the primary constraint. Here using agentic AI designing a robotics cell becomes as easy as DIY. You come you just mention

your requirements and the agents do all the deep research. They give you the design of the cell and how it will look like. They give you the deployment architectures with engineering drawings

and the step-by-step procedure. How do you really put this solution together? You can also visualize them as videos how will it look like in your factory. Uh can we hold here please?

Yes. So uh that is the first phase. Now what it does is that a manufacturer tier one tier 2 small manufacturer who today does not have the knowhow to build such engineering solution in house even he

can easily design and deploy. So that is the first module. Then we move on to the second phase where we have to program. Literally entire automation similar to softwares runs on uh programming. So in

the second phase the agents they also can generate the programs literally entire entire world 50% run uh automation runs on PLC's alone. The PLC's can be programmed rest of all if

you cover the rest 30% about 80% is covered by PLC's CNCs and robots. So all that can be done through agenti. Uh can we play the video please? So here what we are showing is a is a live example

with a Japanese company where we did robot programs. Now this is a physical AI. What happens generally is that somebody asked me why Chad GPD can't do this. What happens is in the real world

you have 3D coordinates. How does the robot understand where is the object placed and how does uh it operate in real world. So that coordinates needs to be inserted. Similarly when it comes to

CNC programming, how does the cutting happens on a workpiece? That needs to be understood by the agents. Only then it can give you the real coordinates. you can simulate, you can see uh and then of

course then push it on to the real machines. Uh can we hold here please? So that is the uh second part for you. So concept designing uh moving on to the programming part and eventually the

final part is you have put the system together, you have deployed it, now you have to troubleshoot it. In the troubleshooting part the agents can still again understand. So it's

basically like creating a brain which understands your factory. There are seven layers and it understands your factory. It understand what is happening, what kind of machines you

have, what kind of processes you have, the components inside the machines, the technology inside of machines, the system integration, how these systems talk to each other, the physical system,

how are they integrated to each other and then the technology inside till subcomponent level. So that is what is required generally when it comes to the maintenance part. So can we uh play this

one please? This is something which we are right now discussing with Indian air force uh where they want to use it as a maintenance co-pilot for high value defense equipment.

So here it's like you just say the error the system tells you how to open it up where exactly in this whole system that particular problem belong and how it can be solved. This UX of course can be

changed. It will evolve over the period of time. But the idea is to say that uh this is the world where we are headed to. So I'm sorry Sor but AI probably will replace but it's not about

replacing. The point is getting to a point where the we can compete against the world. The genie is anyways out of the bottle. There is no controlling it. So this is

it from my side. We are uh exhibiting at hall 14 uh pod 43. Please visit us. We can show more demonstrations. Uh I think I'm on time. If anybody has any questions for me, we can uh do that.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Um our final speaker is Rohitas Shadep Sharma from Socket AI labs. &gt;&gt; Hi uh good afternoon everyone. Uh I'm Rohitash. I look at uh business and

partnerships at Socket Labs. Uh we are a deep tech deep tech startup uh based out of Bangalore. founded back in 2019. Uh we are into building core foundation models and today I'm just I'm not just

here to talk about socket but also I'll be talking about some of the aspects that were discussed uh during the panel discussion around sovereignity. uh because in this era sovereignty is

not just a slogan or something you know uh I feel it's it's it's bit more technical and uh the India mission represents a clear strategic discussion around it given the type of the kind of

support that we have received from the mission it it's just phenomenal and we we couldn't have ever imagined that coming from a you know a small room of six people can actually you know get

this kind of a support from a national mission from a national uh uh initiative. So yeah u like how uh in during the panel discussion Neil sir uh said that very some said something very

correctly that you know sovereignity means not having your kill switch with someone else and uh it it sounds it might sound dramatic but it's it's real it can be it can be subtle so imagine

API access limits uh policy changes compute restrictions uh sanctions uh licensing terms changes so all these can actually hamper your critical digital systems that you thought were

foundational that you thought were sovereign if they are dependent on foreign systems. Uh so it's not just about building the foundation ourselves. So innovation uh rests on stable

grounds. Uh can I please request to play the video? So under the India AI mission uh project AAR has been selected as India's open foundation model initiative uh built by

socket labs. It's a 120 billion parameter open-source multilingual foundation model. Uh but the real headline is not the size, it's the ownership, ownership

of the data pipeline, training stack, evaluation, uh ecosystem, safety framework. When you control the foundation, you control the trajectory. So you can design the uh you can design

for Indian scale, you can design for global south scale. uh as part of AKA uh for the first phase uh we are building AA code uh because sovereignity must translate into productivity and AA code

is about all is all about execution uh it's a in-house math and code foundation model uh with AI assisted coding secure code generation and summarization analytics at scale and enterprisegrade

data workflows this is about strengthening our engineering layer internally In the next phase uh which is yet to come we'll be focusing on uh AKA defense uh in defense and critical

infrastructure we like I don't think any country or any nation in this world has an option to outsource that kind of an intelligence so it has to stay within the country within our people and we are

building it these systems are built for secure inference uh sensor reasoning autonomous systems mission critical reliability uh in these domains independ

independence is not optional, it's foundational. Now, let's just uh widen the lens a bit. Uh this is also a global south moment. Many emerging economies face similar challenges. Multilingual

complexity, infrastructure constraints, afford uh affordability pressure, strategic dependency risks and messy and noisy environments. We don't have these kind of issues with the western markets

and therefore the western models seem so impressive to us. But India and the global south needs different models. They don't they we don't need to replicate GPT or Claude or Gemini.

That's not the point. If India builds sovereign AI capabilities successfully under the mission, it does more than strengthen our domestic ecosystem. It reshapes how partnerships evolve within

the global south countries because when India can offer regionally relevant models, collaborative infrastructure frameworks, secure deployment capabilities, it shifts the equation

from dependency to partnerships and that has economic, strategic and geopolitical implications as well. So when we talk about AA code or AKA defense, we are really talking about one integrated

direction. Build the foundation, strengthen execution, secure the strategic layer, all aligned under the India mission. And if you'd like to see the uh see our models in action, some of

them uh I invite you to visit our booth at Hall 5 ground floor 5.20 booth at Bhat Mandap. Uh I'd be happy to uh continue the conversation over there. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Okay, thank you Roash. Um, so with this we are at the end of our session. Uh, I would like to announce that for all speakers, NASCOM will be planting 10

trees each and we will be sharing the digital certificate by today. Um, I would also invite the speakers on stage uh to pass on the uh speaker momentos. speakers for the panel as well as for

the founder segment.
