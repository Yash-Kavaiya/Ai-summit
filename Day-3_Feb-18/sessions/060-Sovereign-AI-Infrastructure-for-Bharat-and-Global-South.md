## 📝 Summary

India's strategic AI infrastructure must be built around three core pillars: security, sustainability, and open standards. Aligned with the objectives of Atmanirbhar Bharat and Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) compliance, this session examines the emerging architecture of sovereign compute ecosystems, including edge–cloud convergence for next-generation (6G) networks, neuromorphic computing, and low-precision inference systems designed for scalable deployment. It further explores multi-agent orchestration frameworks and cross-sector compute-exchange models that can expand access to high-performance computing for startups, academia, and public institutions. Such an approach aims to democratise advanced computational resources while strengthening India's long-term digital sovereignty, innovation capacity, and research acceleration.
