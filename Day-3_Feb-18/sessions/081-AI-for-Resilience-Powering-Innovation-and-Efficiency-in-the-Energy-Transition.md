## 📝 Transcript

We we were on the other room. So Shivumar Kalyan Raman CEO of ANRF and S Ashish Kana director general of international solar alliance. I guess

he's also finding his way to come here. Just try to call. As you all know, energy is the foundation for not only AI for everything. Life is

driven by energy on earth and that comes from solar or sun. The foundation layers of AI which you talk about are all on energy and our utilities.

Traditionally till last century electric utilities were considered to be very lagards in technology adoption. After the Y2K and other trials and tribulations with the

utilities gone through at the turn of the century and automation and IT system started maturing, their confidence in trying new technologies increased and as a result

two decades down the line today all new technologies have applications in the power sector. artificial intelligence, blockchain, energy storage, all new technologies which has emerged in the

last two decades are successfully being implemented. When it comes to AI, it was desperate systems in different utilities. So 2 years ago when we looked at it, even in

India, several utilities have implemented certain systems but there was no uniform what to implement, how to implement, what is the benefit. There was a fair amount of confusion in

utilities. So we thought of preparing a handbook compiling the details of what successful AI ML robotics use cases in various utilities across the globe. So it was not an easy task. We went around

we made a standard template wrote to utilities whom we know across the globe requested them to share data. very few of them shared data and that to those who shared they shared limited data as a

result the the handbook which we have Reena do we have a copy of the handbook? Yeah. Yeah. Just show me one as a result this handbook which we published in November last year. This

has 174 use cases which we shortlisted after studying more than several hundred use cases covering power generation including renewable energy, power transmission, power trading, power

distribution, uh robotic process automations, security operation centers etc. And thereafter several new things which you have seen and we shortlisted 174 use cases from 35

countries and about 40 plus use cases are from India. So, so this handbook we also covered the policy framework what are the governing AI robotics and also the standards evolving several standard

development organizations are working actively on development of standards. So this covers all that in one uh concise book although it's 300 pages plus but it's a one compilation where

you could find all this with the links. So we are trying to get the other two uh speakers from the other room. Yeah there there he comes. Please come sir. [laughter]

And as is in the other room you can go and get him. He's coming. Okay. So I when the first draft was ready we sent it to some peer for reviews. Many people have given us a very uh

valuable comments which we incorporated and published this in 2025 November and we also wrote in this we are open to take comments from people from around the

world and we will come out with a better edition maybe end of this year and with more use cases and many of the publications which came later some of them which are released 2 days ago

yesterday and day before in this AI summit also referred to this publication which utilities and other uh practitioners in the industry found very useful. Thank you very much. With this

we'll invite uh Ganesh G for his uh opening address. Good morning. Good morning everyone. I think all charged with AIM right. So

I think let me at the outset thank uh ISGF for inviting me to be a part of this particular important session today and I think we are coming from a very very other important session which was

happening just previous to this wherein P2P was being discussed peer-to-peer concept was being discussed and which has been already uh I think launched right

has it been launched yeah but in a in small scale. Now the use cases what Reggie was talking just now probably we have no other options but to identify good

amount of use cases and try to see where all we can have it in the in the energy sector and in particular in the in the power sector. Some of the things definitely of course

one which has been already shown by energy uh India energy stack but probably we need to have something which is in the core of the power sector and that is uh applications in the power

systems particularly in the I I I take it from the very basics that can our planning process improve using AI systems. planning means I you can have resource

adequacy planning, you can have transmission planning, you can have distribution network planning, distribution power purchase planning. So any number of things are there which can

which needs to be optimized in the power sector. So first part where I see it happening is in the planning space which is which is very very lowhanging fruit. Of course we had been doing to some

extent but I still feel that huge amount of in I mean churning is required in the in the resource adequacy plan which we started around 3 years to four years back. We have reached to certain level

but huge amount of other uh improvements are required to be done. Similar happens with the transmission distribution planning as well. Then comes the operation part. Are we really having a

optimal operation in the grid? I mean that's a question we keep on asking ourselves even though we keep on claiming that we don't have outage at the at the large scale uh we are able to

manage the renewables to an extent that even more than 50% of renewable have been integrated into the system but still we are able to hold the grid in a in a right manner but again the we keep

on asking are we heading towards something which needs to be corrected at this point of time and if So can AI help in in in making the operations better and better each time that we think of it

divides into two aspects. One is the grid operation part of it and the second is the management of the local area uh in terms of the distributed generations or even in terms of the micro grid and

miniig grids etc etc. Now third very very important is the asset management. How do we really are we are we really managing our own assets particularly in the distribution segment in a in a

manner in which it is supposed to be done or are we over purchasing or we underpurchasing I mean all these kind of things that is that is there and probably here again I

feel that still we are not doing in a right manner and we need huge amount of uh optimization that is required which can keep I mean which can save cost and also the time of restoration etc etc

resilience reliability reliability is another factor probably I think we keep on talking about the resilience and the reliability in so many words but even though we have achieved certain quantum

of reliability I'll say uh to an extent but if you really go towards the ruler areas probably you'll feel that still the kind of reliability and quality of supply

that is needed into the system we are far far behind uh the that that kind of that kind of achievement if that is also to be integrated in a similar manner what we are trying to do in Delhi Mumbai

and Hyderabad etc. So can what are the things that is required to be done? I mean this is a question which we should keep asking and can some of these tools can help us in in doing this.

Nothing can happen without a good policy and regulatory space and I feel that huge amount of things that is required to be done in the policy front as well because many a times what happens is we

know the problems which we try to solve through the policies. Many times we succeed but most of the times we fail as well. So how do we reduce the the chance of failures and how do we increase the

probability of success? Probably AI may help us in doing that. Some of the things in the regulatory space particularly you must have seen that huge amount of litigations are happening

in the power sectors. regulator all the regulators whether it is state regulators, central regulators or the applet they are all loaded with the petitions. How do we reduce these kind

of litigations? Can something be done uh by strandation? Maybe a strandation of change in law, strandation of force major conditions all these if can be listed. Can we have the entire journey

of the entire process of tariff determination itself which can be made transparent wholly transparent and can be made automated so that at least you don't need to have those kind of uh

delays in terms of the issuing of telephone orders and then revalidating it drew up etc etc. So can can that be done? Can the transmission license or the the tradeoff license be issued in a

simple and very transparent manner through a portal itself? No need to file a petition. I have seen there are number of cases wherein the issuance of transmission lines gets delayed by a

year or so. It keeps on lying with the regulator and they are not able to process it in that manner. So if we can avoid these delays which [clears throat] is a paperwork which the the developer

and the same timelines can be passed on to the developers probably the faster development of the infrastructure can can happen in the in the in the in this particular segment. Capacity building

another very good use case wherein AI can be helping the power sectors uh and particularly and lot of lot of initiative have been taken by various departments wherein modules have been

made the capacity building uh programs have been done but I still feel that huge amount of uh work is required to be done in in these areas as well so the I I'll only say uh at this moment is power

sector is opening up and huge amount of opportunities, use cases are waiting uh for this kind of innovative solutions and I think we need to catch up and we need to speed up so that at least we

don't fall behind anybody else. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Thank you very much. [applause] Yeah. The honor to invite Sri Ashyel

chairman up corporation. Uh thank you Pelisa my dear colleague uh my respected colleague Shrian Chambers gi chairman CEA he has been a I would say a very knowledgeable voice

in the power sector now my old friend Ashish Karn kaji director general ISA all the esteemed panel esteemed uh participants of this session.

I come with a perspective from a discom what used to be all it is now all AI. So everything is AI but what AI is nobody understands. How to do it nobody understands but

everything is AI. So we have artificial intelligence and natural stupidity. So number one as a discom what I want number one I want people who know what

the use cases are. ISGF has a very fortunately come up with 174 use cases all over the world. So I want use cases. Bring me use cases. I will give you order.

bring me use cases, I will engage you. Nobody brings me use cases because people are not conversent with the power sector. So what I suggest there are youngsters who have ideas. There are

youngsters who know about it, who know about AI but they don't know about the But we have a lot of our retired employees. Many people who have put put in decades

of work in power sector. They are experts of power sector but they may not know much about the IT or AI. Can these two not join hands and bring value to the sector?

I hold uh retirement functions at the end of each month whenever my engineers are retiring. I tell them don't sit idle at home. Join with youngsters. Come up with some use cases. Come up come up

with some value creation. So there is a lot of value to be created in this field. Right now we have this problem of people having energy, bright ideas but no experience. and on the other end

having old ideas, huge experience but lacking in the uh modern practices and understanding of AI. If these two combined I think it'll bring a lot of value and

who will bring such people together they need to be platform maybe ISGF please uh you know you have contacts in both kind of uh both you travels both the worlds so probably some startups which have

both old and young people they will bring value. Right now I need people who can understand what use cases I need and who can implement them. Number two procurement

it is a very big big thing. How do I make a procurement build for AI services for use cases? How do I value your knowledge? It cannot be an L1. It cannot be a QCBS.

what price do I what value do I give to your service? So procurement is a very very difficult thing and ministry or CA may like RC has uh come up with powerthorn. We are

engaging with those vendors who have won powerthon but we need much more institutional clarity on how to procure AI services from the market. They should not well we should

not be taken for a ride. So that is a very very important thing. Even if we know such such people are good how do we take them on board? I will give you an example. There is a party who has won

powerthon. They are doing the uh GIS mapping of the whole electricity infrastructure. The total cost for the whole state will come to around 200 cr rupees. So how do I give a tender to one

party &gt;&gt; for 200 cr rupees but I know they will do it because the alternative before me is another offer which is more than 800 crores and which is not reliable if I do

it in the oldfashioned way. So I'm stuck how do I how do I go ahead? So for a very small uh ticket size I can take the risk but not for a big ticket size. So how do I move forward when I

when we are scaling up these use cases for the statewide or disform. So these are the two major questions before uh the discoms which is preventing us from uh adopting AI on a

huge large scale. The other thing that I am we have made an organization called oriented discom organ discom association and different discoms are in different stages of uh digitalization.

Nobody knows what should be the ideal road map for digitalization. So we are discussing this in our association. Let us create a road map which is common to all.

It should have checklists for different departments. There can be technical checklist. There will be can be a commercial checklist, procurement checklist, quality control checklist,

specifications checklist. So there can we can create a road map for the whole discom for all the departments or all the verticals of the discom say after 5 years after 10 years and

what should be our digitalization road map. Since we are in AI summit, I'm talking about digitalization. For other uh conferences, we will have technical and other matters also. So what should

be our digitalization road map? If there can be a common digitalization road map, it will bring clarity to both the industry to the discom manner. So all these things need to be

thought of. I am very happy to announce here that uh with the collaboration of IM Lucknau we have recently launched an MBA course for power sector professionals which will be the first

badge will be starting this year and this is open for all the power sector professionals from all over the country. So for capacity building also we need a concerted and a joint effort in this

area. Thank you very much. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. will now invite Shukumar Kalyan Ramen my ex-colague and friend during my IBM days and also CEO of ANRF. I hope most of you know what is ANRF.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Rejie and um my respects to the uh you know dignitaries on the dis and um you know I will start with where Reggie left off. How many of you know about ANRF?

Ah okay. So um uh how many know of you know about a one lakh cr fund called RDI? Okay. All right. So it might be good for you to check it out. Okay. So anyway so

um uh Anusundhan National Research Foundation is um a new statutory body. Um we are only 2 years old. Um and um I have taken office only about 10 months back. So I don't blame you for not

knowing us. Um that's number one and um uh so the role of Anusandha National Research Foundation is to um help transform and help the rise or catalyze the rise of India as a research and

innovation powerhouse. Okay. So since it's a a panel about power I want to say that uh that's our mission statement. Of course we have um two major vehicles for driving um our work. One is um a patient

capital program called RDI uh research development and innovation fund which is a 1 lakh cr fund. There that purpose of that fund is to make an asset class happen for a first of a kind or early

stage research and development in the private sector. that is only for a private sector fund to help translate and scale uh innovations, translate and scale um research, development and

innovation intensive um innovations. Uh so please look up that as right now um the government the honorable prime minister announced this fund on November 3rd and we have already operationalized

this in the last 3 months and we have already given out 4,000 crores to intermediate fund managers and uh there is uh the rest of alternate investment uh uh fund managers are being evaluated.

We expect to uh close another round of um um you know allocations by uh April or May. uh so then there'll be a large amount of money available for um patient capital in the sector uh in uh in the

RDI sector. So what that means is patient capital means either soft loans which are longdated and um and low interest rate like 4% or 5% interest rates but for a tenor of 10 or 15 years

but to help translate uh innovations that can be um uh leaprog in nature uh research development and in um innovation intensive in nature. So therefore we would expect that industry

would collaborate with academia um take uh those um uh technologies. When I say academia, I also include the research labs, the power labs and others. U bring technology both from India and also

abroad and but at the same time there has to be significant value addition in our country uh so that we uh we become atman and uh drive these transformations. So the goal here is to

really drive um you know a lot more financing uh for the deep tech sector uh in general. So that is the RDI fund. The second um part of our program is uh grant program where we are doing uh both

uh foundational support like the National Science Foundation in the United States or like DARPA which where we doing mission mode uh or challenge mode uh programs um and I look forward

to working with my colleagues uh seated here from the government on u various things as well as we're working with line ministries as they operationalize their missions in various areas. uh ANRF

will be partnering with various line ministries. Since um ANRF is a neutral entity in government, we are a statutory body that is um uh precided by the honorable prime minister himself. So we

um you know work very seamlessly and collaborate with different parts of the government. uh and I'm happy to report to you that we already have launched multiple mission mode programs uh with

several uh ministry several departments not just the scientific departments like ICMR or um you know I came from a panel just now on AI for science and engineering uh where we are partnering

with MIT uh the India AI mission we are partnering with DRDO we are partnering with DBT with the ministry of earth sciences on weather and climate forecasting how to use AI for some of

these things which has an implication for uh you know renewables forecasting and so on. Since I come from this area, I used to serve as the CTO for energy. So, I'm familiar with some of the

problems in this sector. So, um in addition to that um the um we are doing pro you know projects on medtech critical raw materials with the ministry of mines. We'll be launching a drones

program uh shortly and I look forward to talking to uh honorable CA and others to see what we can do a lot more in power sector. I've been challenging I IGSF, ISGF to come to me with um you know uh

opportunities where we can um you know drive challenge mode uh programs uh in these areas as well right so please uh take advantage of IGSF and um you know and also I'm pleased to see several of

your use cases but when we are funding uh Anusunda National Research Fund is running we will look at root node problems what are the core hard problems to be solved u and then once that is

solved of course uh in some cases we to open IP and those sorts of things which will help the entrepreneurs quickly translate that uh into impact. Uh I also come from the industry. I spent half my

career in industry. I used to be in academia before and I have worked in this sector before and I look forward to more collaboration. So that's the message I want to leave with you. Um and

I look forward to learning from my uh learned colleagues here about the challenges and then where um AI especially since I've been in applied uh gen and other things in my past roles

you know I think we can quickly collaborate and to do substantial things. Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you SH. We'll now invite Sri Asha director general

Good afternoon everyone and uh thank you to ISGF for giving me this opportunity and my friends and colleagues Mr. Gancham Prasad Gi Ashish Goel great to meet uh Mr. Kumar also uh let me first

start by talking about two things. Why is International Solar Alliance in the AI summit? Uh we are in the AI summit because of two parts. First of the 1,000 gawatt of solar that happened in just

last two years 40% is decentralized renewable energy which means rooftop solar pumps. That figure in India is only 15%. So it's going to grow up multiffold but

as you will hear from distribution companies who find it very difficult financially due to net metering but the systems cannot absorb. This is a classic problem in Pakistan, Sri Lanka where

rooftop solar program has stopped and we don't want discoms to become the opponents of decentralized renewable energy because actually for the system it is much better to do a much cheaper

decentralized renewable energy as long as foundational IT architecture exists to manage that load variability and pricing in terms of various services like batteries and others that need be

needed. Number one. Number two, as you Ashish was very rightly saying, AI is a buzz word. Everybody, you want to increase the valuation of your company, just add AI into that. We have to change

that. We have to see what is it that makes a lot of sense. And one thing that is missing in India. But as we represent 125 countries, we see globally there is no standard IT architecture of what are

the different things that need to happen to actually reach use of AI. For example, I have African countries which want to do a digital twin without having a meter. I said hello, it's not possible

to even think about a digital twin if you don't have smart meters, you don't have basic SCADA and others. So we need a taxonomy that defines in your IT architecture what are the different

phases that are essential prerequisites for you to start with basic digital equipment then digitization whether you are looking at uh elements of SCADA or others and then digital twinning and a

lot of other AI applications of that. So therefore in this AI summit we launched a global AI mission for energy 2 days back. What are we really trying to do? First of all, I must confess if

those of you are not aware of it, I encourage you to see what India is trying to do through India energy stack and what's very interesting about that is those who just understand technology

want to create a technology answer but as we all know technology is only an enabler until unless it can be mainstream in the then you have financiers like RC you have policy

makers like Mr. Ghana Prasad who are talking at the big picture you have ministry of power which is trying to see what it means in terms of RDSS and you have discoms who are saying look I must

understand financially what's happening all of them are trying to come together to a create a nomenclature of all the 84 discoms B come out which doesn't exist in the world I must confess because I

have checked the entire OECD developed world that is there a data policy for distribution in which every consumer consumer which becomes a consumer actually has a

digitally signed certificate to allow to trade through cyber security that doesn't exist in the world today but India energy stack is trying that once you have the basic elements can you

actually create a form by which a lot of people with because the future in 5 years is millions of people will have both rooftop and batteries and maybe looking at ways to do P2P trading as

just happened so we are trying to bring all of that as India energy stack as a gift of India to the world to do five things. Number one, the standards that India decides must be

harmonized with the world because otherwise they'll become India standards. That's not how internet and other things came out. They have to be interoperable standards shared by the

world. Two, something on skilling that was being discussed. We want to create an ISA academy that brings AI skills and electrical engineering skills together. We are now seeing across the countries

electrical engineers think of it as second grade and AI engineers do not understand electrical engineering but the world needs to come together. So that by the way may itself need an AI

based learning management tools in addition to great uh physical courses like I'm luck you heard about third is startup ecosystem some of it is happening as in happening

in digital twin in Japur it's being done and I see dh also here a lot of digital twins are happening but I think lot of thousand flowers will have to bloom on trying to do different innovations on

different startups our job is to connect India to the rest of the global South in all those startups. We ourselves have funded 70 startups. The fourth is what it means in terms of

financing. Lot of patient capital is required for some of these pilots procurement included and we are trying to create a financing and de-risking facility of

patient capital for doing some of it and uh finally document all the use cases. So there are digital twins that are being done in India. We are focusing a lot more on decentralized renewable

energy only. But we want to document all the use cases. So five pillars interoperability, skills, use cases of AI, startup ecosystem and financing. All these five we actually have demand from

about three four discoms in India maybe five or six other countries. But why we are very excited? because the future of renewable energy will be intertwined with AI and secondly a lot of innovation

will happen in the developing world starting with India to actually do it. So we really look forward. Thank you. I will now request uh my colleague Disha who was the project manager for this

handbook to make a quick presentation about what it contains. Over to you. Uh good afternoon everyone. I'll just upload my presentation and then we'll start.

So give me a second. So yeah, good afternoon everyone. I'm Disha Kosla from India's Margaret Forum. I have the honor to present our handbook on AI, ML, AR, VR and robotic solutions

and roadmap for adoption electric utilities. So this handbook which we've already talked about is a compilation of 174 successful use cases of these applications implemented by power

utilities across 35 countries. So this will help the utilities in unlocking new efficiencies using AI, ML, AR and these new technologies. So it this handbook also analyzes global policies,

regulatory frameworks and evolving international standards. So most importantly it provides a clear road map for the utilities based on their digital maturity levels. And so as I have told

you that it it has 174 successful use cases which is further categorized under generation transmission distribution system operations power trading robotic process automation and security

operation centers. And uh most of the data which we have got is me mentioned in the main report and the appendices. So uh talking about the use cases I'll

just read out because we don't have time. So the use cases uh covered in this handbook are categorized across the entire power value chain and it can it has predictive maintenance of the power

infrastructure, renewable energy forecasting, grid management with DR, power thread detection, dynamic load forecasting, integration of electric vehicles, power trading optimization,

optimization of energy storage systems, stripping analysis at grid substation level and then we have distribution transformer monitoring, network reliability analysis, There's revenue

max max maximization. So there are lot uh so whatever you name we have covered almost everything across all power value. So uh talking about the structure of the use cases which we have presented

in the handbook. The use cases are starting from the problem statement and we end to the achievements almost covering everything which is important for a use case. Since most of the

utilities did not share the cost and benefit. So we couldn't uh have the detailed cost benefit analysis for each use case. Talking about the key insights which we have gathered from these use

cases, uh we have uh collected 174 global use cases out of which we could see that the utilities have reported almost 15 to 40% reduction in unplanned outages, 10 to 25% reduction in O&amp;M

cost, 20 to 30% improvement in asset life, reduction in ATC losses, better renewable energy forecasting and grid integration and improved grid reliability and resilience is are the

key other benefits. So the important takeaway which we had gathered or we could take from these use cases that that the there are very good use cases that a utility can start even

at an early stage of the digitalization journey. There's no need to wait that we will become full digitalization will happen in a utility before implementing these solutions like uh we can start

with ERP data for asset optimization ARVR for training and capacity building call log analytics for improving customer engagements and billing and collection data for revenue protection.

So these are some of these things we can start and in this handbook we have not only covered the use cases we have also focused on the uh global standards and governance which is there for these

solutions. So globally you can see that EU has already introduced world's first comprehensive AI act in 2024. OECD promotes trustworthy AI principles and this UK energy regulatory of gem has

issued ethical AI guidelines. uh while Singapore has a practical AI governance framework. So global directions are very clear that AI must be transparent, accountable, safe and humanentric. So

this uh handbook covers every of these aspects in detail. You can just go through this uh handbook. We will share the link with you. And we also cover the Indian standards which are being issued

by BIS and we have covered most of these in this handbook. Talking about the key gaps identified when we were studying these, we had uh categorized into four which is digital

infrastructure gaps, regulatory and policy gaps, capacity and institutional gaps, financing and procurement challenges which we have catered to through our road map. So talking about

our implementation road map, you can see that after the detailed study which we had done about the global case studies, we could divide the discom into three categories. maturity levels which is

initiators, integrators, optimizers. So like um Kanasa said that we can categorize and see that which desk is at which stage of maturity level and then they can have those use cases

implemented first. So then we have a phase road map also for this which is divided into short-term goal, medium-term goal and long long-term goals. Now talking about these uh key

recommendations, we have also given key recommendations for different type of stakeholders also which is government and policy makers, regulators, utility leaderships and technology providers. So

now concluding my PPT and not taking much time, I would like to state that AIA in the power sector is no longer an optional thing. It is becoming a foundation to grid resilience, renewable

integration and operational efficiency. And this is the time that the power utilities should leave. Thank you very much. [applause] Uh may I now uh request uh all the

speakers and the panels um because we want to have a photograph so that we can distribute as a last uh at the time of momento. I'll request everyone to please &gt;&gt; other panelists also I'll invite on the

stage please so that we can just take a photograph quickly and then um we can distribute as a mento at the last. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

opposition and rolling back. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank thank you very much to Torina for moderating the panel. Uh we are left with 10 minutes but we'll take

extra 10 minutes or 20 minutes. The organizers [laughter] no problem enough to give us time. &gt;&gt; We started late so we'll take extra 10 minutes or 20 minutes to you.

&gt;&gt; A very good afternoon everyone. We will continue with our uh next panel which is a very powerp packed panel. Uh I request our panelists to please uh join us on the days. Uh

please join me in welcoming Mr. Dijadas Basak CEO Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited. Mr. Abhishek Ranjan, CEO BRPL, Mr. Naven Shivaswa, Director Operations from Power Grid

Corporation Limited. Miss Jacqueline Cochran, associate lab director, US DOE National Lab of the Rookies. Mr. Sadhart Aurora, Associate Partner, Clean Energy Energya Ventures Private Limited. And uh

last but not the least, we have Mr. Prashant Dangash, CEO and co-founder of Impressa AI. I request please uh settle down everyone. we we have very uh less time

left and we uh need to get started with all our uh panelists. So we've heard uh powerful perspectives at the AI summit in the last two days uh on the scale and urgency of India's

energy transition and the theme of the summit itself uh is impact. Nowhere is that impact more critical than in our energy sector. And leaders from uh around the world and the leaders who

joined us uh in the previous session uh they they have emphasized on the fact that our path to dollar 5 million trillion economy is paved with green electrons. But those

electrons will only flow reliably if uh you know they are directed by intelligent algorithms rather than manual interventions. And also this summit is built on sutras like people,

planet and progress. And our session AI for resilience is where three these three meet all together. And when we talk about planet we are talking about intelligent uh integrating uh uh

renewables at a scale never seen before. And when we talk about progress, we are talking about AIdriven forecasting and automation. Excuse me. Progress and you know that makes our

utilities. Yeah. And we when we talk about uh progress we also uh you know want talk about the the AIdriven forecasting and automation that

makes our utilities globally competitive and most importantly when we talk about people we are talking about the future ready skills. Our engineers need to lead this datadriven revolution and our

speakers have also highlighted the requirement of skill before we uh pave our way towards an IIDriven uh intelligent grid. And with this session today uh we would like to focus on how

we move from datadriven uh datari utilities to AI intelligent utilities. We have smart meters, sensors, a lot of DRS generating billions of data points coming up. But the true value lies in

converting that data into grid flexibility and commercial efficiency. And uh our ISGF handbook uh reveals that our utilities are operationally ready for AI deploy. Many use cases we have

seen with which have you know fieldproven case studies included which are are already defining the grid reliability. So therefore the critical question I want to start with uh before

the panel is uh that uh you know the question for uh uh today's panel which is that are we ready for AI. I I think you will all agree that you know we are ready and we are getting there. But uh

the real questions are how do we move from pilots to enterprisewide operations and how do we ensure AI enhances resilience without creating new risks and how do

policy regulations and investment frameworks evolve alongside the technology. And with that let me uh turn to our distinguished panelist. Uh let me invite uh Mr.

uh Daj Dadas Basuchi CEO TPD deal sir TPD deal doesn't you know manage a grid but they manage a massive digital uh ecosystem and serving 2 million consumers and uh Mr.

the like you know with the utility which has moved beyond pilots in analytics and automation what are the key internal enablers organizational technological and financial enablers that have allowed

you to scale up AI from isolated use cases to enterprise level operations over to you sir &gt;&gt; yeah thank you thank you Reena uh basically it's a uh really uh the main

question of the day today and also the future uh adoption of AI we had been listening to AI is uh not only a technology this is not only a technology lip it's not

buying technology it is basically having a disciplined transformation of the digitalization you have lot of data generated from the technology that you are adopting like

for example we in Tatap power DDL what we did is that we had started this journey in 2005 five through two 10 years road map and each road map was for a period of 10 years so 20 years and

where we covered the entire journey from a smart grid to smart meters the entire and that gave us today a entire transparency of uh the data from the grid to the customers. So I have each

and every uh details but what am I doing with the details? That is the main question. So the point is that terabytes of data is being

sourced. It is being produced but if I am not using it properly uh it's of no use. what we the methodology that we had adopted is as rightly said by [clears throat] I think uh uh uh

chairman C was mentioning about that that use cases or sorry uh chairman upcl was mentioning about Mr. Well, yes, we had gone for use cases and for each use case we used to do pilots

and by maturing the pilots then we started scaling it up for the entire organization and we did it for each and every aspect. It's not only grid.

We started experimenting or handling data that we are generating for meter reading. Simple meter reading from the data we are generating from the disconnection reconnection.

The data that we are generating from datas of consumers disconnection reconnection. By that we started predicting which consumers are going to default in the near future. And when I

know which consumers are have high probability of disconnection of defaulting I don't need to send team to each and every defaulter I know these consumers are there who can pay so these

are the use and I reduce my expenditure I reduce my cost on&amp;m cost for example in ATNC loss we had traveled a journey from 53% ATNC in 2002 when we took over today we are at less than 6% %

how it has been achieved it is basically by using the data that we had been generating from the AMR meters and using it in a very very uh rational manner logical manner

and whatever experience we were gaining we were putting it back to the system to refine that logic. Now this process took a lot of time. What AI will do today is that this process the AI will do. The

more you start giving data to the uh system, the AI will have a self learning process by which what logical changes I am doing manually in the system today that need

not be done that the AI will now do it and that will be more perfect. So that is the advantage of having AI in the grid part. Yes, the entire grid like starting from ADMS, GIS, smart meter

data. Now these lots of data. Now what we are trying to do is to create a data historian or a data lake where we'll put all the data and from there we will have AI enabled insights to create sorry AI

enabled systems to create insights which we can use for asset management for uh network planning for uh power and talking about power procurement this is becoming a big challenge on the uh

the great grid will be having in the near future a lot of challenges uh based on due to uh EV penetration then solar then V2G or vehicle to grid peer-to-peer a lot of comp the grid is be is going to

become huge uh like heavily complicated so we need system automated system to control it so from that perspective I can tell you that AI will be required in the near future. But this term should

not be misused. It is not simple using data. It is using data in a very very disciplined manner. And the more good data you put in the system, the better insights you will get. Garbage in

garbage out concept. So thanks. That's my &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Mr. Basak. I'll quickly move to we have we've been given some extra time but we'll quickly move

to Abhishek Ranjan GI CEO of BRPL to give his uh inputs and um you know we we had already discussed what we are looking forward to hear from him so over to you sir

&gt;&gt; thank you Reina and carrying forward from what Mr. Basak my colleague has said see utilities like us discoms are sitting at a sweet spot convergence of grid and consumer.

So what happens is consumers would expect us to behave and have similar experience if not better just like they're getting on other uh you know avenues like for example Amazon

experiences there or maybe they have experiences the telecom providers like Aireljio they have their own ecosystem. So that is a kind of expectation and then now the uh now the era of 10

minutes delivery right. So Amazon now or BB Delhi these kind of expectations are now being set. So that is one expectation which has to be met. 23 years ago when both of us TPDL and

BACS we started our journey in Delhi the expectation was completely different. Okay. The expectation was 24/7 power availability which was a rarity. Then the network was in very poor and shabby

uh you know condition. Transformer burnouts were very normal. There were wire dangling here and there. Customer care was not existent. You had to travel to so many places to pay your bills and

you were not sure whether to pay the bill, where to pay and how to pay. Now now today if you speak to the customers they will say those things are done fine thank you but then we want to move to

the next orbital shift in Delhi you have multiple delies you talk about South Delhi the expectation is at par if not better than global standards in North America Europe etc they'll demand the

same kind of uh thing they would have seen their relatives are there in say Frankfurt or maybe US I mean the same kind of expectations required then there is is a rural Delhi where still roti

kaplamaka the basics okay so I want power that's it so the expected what I'm trying to say here is the technology is to be leveraged to manage all these diverse kinds of expectations I mean we

are serving multi-etss of consumer at the same time zone and therefore technologies like AI are going to be helpful Mr. Basak talked about so many AI based applications grid side consumer

side I mean I'll welcome you to ISA pavilion I mean Mr. Tashish Karna was here and there I think we have demonstrated five or six real life cases you can actually have a hands-on it's

not a PPD so this is how Tatas and VCS we're doing uh uh and and then other utilities will also follow suit so without taking much ado to deliver the kind of performance required now from us

the artificial intelligence machine learning agent and then different kinds of AI I mean classical then you have gener ative agentic all these things are going to play. I think time is up. Over

to you Reena. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for your input. I think we need five more minutes. We have uh very uh important more speakers uh to uh you know go please uh I request

organizers and with that let me invite Mr. Naven Shivas GI director operations PGCIL. PGCL is managing the backbone of power systems. So over to you for your input sir.

&gt;&gt; Thank you madam. Thank you uh IGF for inviting me for this discussion. I'll take up now there were two giants from distribution sector. I'll take you to the you know transmission sector.

Powergate used to be you know first pioneer where the transmission started in India in 1989. This was the first public sector came out and when we have started the transmission I'll take you

from there. I tell you in 1989 now we are in 2026. The thing is the legacy has gone. That's we used to operate the transformers and transmission line that now it is getting

increased from now 18 to now it is 290 substations and around 1 lakh 80,000 circuit kilometers to operate these system. It's not easy to do it manually. So we have to be a we have to go in the

path. It was necessity that we have to go in the digital path. That started in 2014 when we decided that we'll operate all the substation by remotely. But it was it was a difficult task. But now you

can see that all the substation not only operated uh uh you know digitally from the one stations. This is the journey started. We have uh now we have a system totally AI enabled. We have come out.

Let me take you in the two directions. One is from the grid operation part when grid operation was with us. We have come out with the AI based uh you know uh renewable energy management system

because renewable energy was coming up. So based on the uh geographical data and you know atmospheric data now the shielding has been done from the that area we are going for the transmission

line substation we have already decided the first word first distal substation made by power gate it is in 765 KV level it is in napsari similarly in the line side also we are making a digital line

which we call as DL that's the first pilot project we have done it so this is where we are moving it the first we have gone for you know not only to operate that we require the datas like frequency

voltage in our hands. So we have gone for VMS system which is already PMUs have allotted in the all whole of India. I'm telling not only for us it is al also for the uh STUs also we have put it

like that way. So this is the part where the grid operation was resilient was required. Second part is to be how we manage the assets in the form because it's not we have at least I'm telling

you at that present I'm having around around 40 terabyte data terabyte data it's it's a it's not easy to unless these we are going for AI based. So we have all the system which we are called

IoT or you call digital tunes. We have the system we have adopted in our all HBDC have a digital tune AC system is coming up. Similarly we have gone for uh you know IoT system. Now we are

operating with the you know pump there is robots in the substations they are moving and they are taking the datas. This is very much required for the transparency of the data and now it is

this these operation we have done. Now part is the analysis is to be done because we have to reduce the outage rates. We have already reduced 99.82% is there. Now further analysis we are going

for asset performance management. It is AI tool. It's a generative AI but how it is to be operated in the electric power sectors. We are coming with that and you'll see that in next 3 years the

analysis and the operations will be digitalized. So I mean to say that this is a a not only requirement now it is a necessity now. Unless you come out with that it will not be possible and you

will see that they are coming up. We have the use cases I have almost not less than uh around 15 16 use cases we have already shown to you know ministry and it is being

adopted not only some and we are going for the some pilot projects also we have COE with the academia also with the IA also and we are coming in the cyber security also how we can use it. So I

want to say is that it is very much required and we are anybody can come out in power and we can show you the use cases. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Mr. Chbas. I request

the next session please just we need two more we have two guests to uh still give us their interventions and quickly you know to over to Miss Jacqueline Kushin for international perspective you know

on on this topic please I will keep it brief but yeah we would want to hear from you. I I work for what the department of energy's national labs. We work on big challenges, 10-year time

frames, and we are working on using AI to rethink all the aspects of grid planning and operations and data and this is a fabulous handbook that gives you a great start. I really want to

congratulate ISGF on that. And then I will just leave you with one teaser. If you could just imagine redoing how do we connect generation and load large load large generation small generation

to the grid. Today we do it interconnection study by interconnection study. But with AI, we can flip that and we can look instead at where do we have needs on the grid and then have a

continuous online system that communicates that to developers so that they know what to bring and we can get rid of all the interconnection cues. Thank you so much uh Jacqueline. And uh

last but not the least just one more industry perspective quickly if you can keep it little brief Mr. Prashant uh you know the Das Gupta please. uh over to &gt;&gt; Sure. So,

you know, I come from the I'm from the other side. As Reena mentioned, I come from the technology side. We provide technology solutions uh AI solutions to discom uh one of the big challenges that

people have is use cases. I think Reggie and uh team have done a great job with this uh and it will make everyone's life easy. However, everyone gets overwhelmed by this, right? what all they supposed

to do. My recommendation always has been start small. Don't try to do everything. It's not going to replace your legacy system. Start with a practical use case for an area that makes sense to you. You

have data and see the impact. A lot of people get overwhelmed thinking about everything. Hey, do we need a data lakehouse? Do we need uh do we need to overwhelm our legacy system? Do we need

a very clean data? No, you don't need all that. What you need is a simple problem that you think is important for you. If you don't have a great quality data, still you can start right. Uh the

new models are fairly efficient in eliminating the noise and we can start from there have practical results and move forward. One of our customers when we started they started with smart meter

operations. Today they are running about 22 models. So all I'm saying is start small, you can get there. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. And please give a big round of applause to all our esteemed

panelists. Uh please do we have the photography? Can we have a quick uh group picture here? &gt;&gt; Thank you everyone for joining us and having the patience for this long

session. It was quite insightful to have you all over here. A kind attention please. Uh this is to inform you that all sessions will get over by 4:20 p.m. today and all participants are requested

to exit the Bharat Pandipam premises by 4:20 p.m. So uh the expo will be remain open till 8:00 p.m. So you can
