## 📝 Summary

From AI-generated content and code to foundation models, traditional boundaries of authorship, inventorship, and ownership are increasingly contested as jurisdictions adapt their intellectual property regimes. The IndiaAI Mission positions indigenous datasets, models, and compute infrastructure as strategic national assets for innovation, exports, and long-term economic growth. Without a future-ready AI–IP framework, India risks legal uncertainty that could constrain innovation and investment. This session situates AI–IP policy within the vision of Viksit Bharat, linking science and innovation, safe and trusted AI, and AI-led economic growth and social good.

## 📝 Transcript

Kumar from Chub and Sabin Malik from Rapid 7. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; No, please. &gt;&gt; Over to you. Sendep sir.

&gt;&gt; Hello. Hi. Good morning to everybody. So we are starting right now. &gt;&gt; What's that? &gt;&gt; So they are requesting for a group photograph first.

&gt;&gt; Can we do it at the end? &gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll do it at the end. &gt;&gt; Yes. Okay. So uh to start this uh session we have a surprise speaker. Uh it's Dr. S.

Chakraarti who is a who who was a a civil servant uh for a long time for almost 40 years and he has retired almost 30 years ago and uh he has a very u you know uh very uh illustrious

career. Uh he was a uh first class first in his university in math and stats. Then uh he got a PhD from uh IIT Delhi and then law degree from Delhi University and he has certifications on

public administration and public enterprises from University of Manchester and Harvard University and he has written books on IPR and competition. It's a very interesting

name IPR bride and competition groom. Another book he has written is privacy right and data protection and uh also another one that he's writing right now is on artificial intelligence. So he

will give a very short uh presentation or very short uh opening remarks on this on the topic of AI IP uh for about 10 minutes before we start the panel officially. Thank you. Please sir

[applause] Uh thank you Professor Sundep uh for your generous introduction. It's a little overwhelming to me. Thank you.

Um I've been asked to um take on the mic in the opening to say a few words about um artificial intelligence whether you need to regulate it at all

or not and also link it up with IPR policy and so on. Um the title itself is very interesting. India AI mission providing an opportunity to position India as a

global leader. I would like to mention to you at the right at the outset that u as professor sep has uh uh categorically mentioned about 10 minutes for me normally I have a feeling I have a

experience that I get carried by my own voice there's a problem but then you must consider it to me because of fact that I'm 88 and I'm sure you'll be indulgent enough if I slightly wore them

on time thank you um indigenous uh models, data sets, compute, infrastructure are expected to become strategic national assets. So I was advised to

present a keynote address covering the role of IPRs in the national policy and relating it to the manner in which the data collected on IPRs could be better handled by AI tools, artificial tools

and if use of AI needs to be regulated at all. This is a vast area and cannot be addressed in the 10 minutes allotted to me. I'll attempt to do this in terms of a short mention of the different

dimensions germanine to the substantive subject of AI's rule and the need or otherwise to regulate AI. The reason I was advised u to do this uh opening remarks is that I had authored a

book as was mentioned u on IPR and competition law. I I I all of you are aware IPR creates monopoly rights and competition law or antitrust law is against frowns on monopoly. So how to

marry them? So I called my the title of the book IPR bride and competition groom. So I'll marry them in that by my book. So that book was in the knowledge of matey and then they said you please

have a session on this right levity apart a can play a substantive role in the process of grant of IPRs by the regulator like control general of

accounts and so on. In case of patent grants, a lot of search takes place if the claimed invention or creativity has been made earlier by somebody else, some third party in the world, not only in

India. The search is manual. But if you have AI, it can do it at less cost and more speed. Scanning documents and data can be done by AI with least error and substantive

speed. Data particular particularly big data you are all aware of um is humongous huge in volume. It is described in terms of five V's. V for victory V. First is velocity. Speed at

which the amount of data is generated. Second is volume. Incredible amount of data generated. Three value worth of the data extracted. Five variety. Worth of the data. Variety

is difficult types of data is collected. So it's a variety. And finally trustworthiness. This trustworthiness is quality and whether the particular data is got

trustworthy when it comes out. So these are the five Bs of big data. Now as you know I IPR it gives you a lot of data. Now IPR at its core has data technology innovation and trust. AI tool can be

designed to handle these dimensions. The AI framework should be so designed that it does not supplant human intelligence or efforts but supplements or augments the human intelligence. It doesn't it is

not a substitute for human intelligence but it it augments human intelligence. So it is much more effective and efficient. AS design should ensure that innovation

is protected, bias is avoided, discrimination is prohibited, privacy is not violated. Let me briefly touch on the upsides and downsides of AI in the context of IPRs and in particular

I can say IPR I'll start with but in addition to that generally AI tool is applied in number of sectors outside IPRs. Now the f I will me mention upsides and

terms very briefly before I go to the other part in if you look at upsides the good part of it AI has been very beneficial to society so it is during the current fifth industrial resol

revolution is defined by AI and its deep association into everyday life. AI is often described as technology enabler with multiplier effect because it

strengthens the existing system rather than operating in isolation. Our honorable prime minister has emphasized during many an occasion that technology in India must be democratized both in

its use and development and that every section of the society must benefit from it. That's very important. every sector of society not just somewhere you apply it relating his call to industrial

progress India is moving towards high automation environment where ASM manage that AI tools they manage inspection assembly intra logistics with minimal human presence that is what AI can do

now [clears throat] there are many more upsides but time constraint compulsment to skip them. Just one aspect of health care. Let me place before you for your information. You are already aware of

it. In the area of health care and wellness of citizens, AA can be a critical tool on how it should serve the hospitals, clinics and citizens subject to appropriate guard rails. AI can

reshape diagnostics, personalized treatment pathways and influence designing of clinical trials and experiments in the fields of radiology and pathology. AM systems have

demonstrated their ability to flag subtle abnormalities, prioritize high-risisk cases and reduce diagnostic cost and delay. So these are all upsides of AIA can do so much. May I

request to finish in one one minute? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Can you finish in one minute? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; One minute. My god.

&gt;&gt; I got to say something more important than this. &gt;&gt; 10 minutes. &gt;&gt; Okay. I'll take five minutes. Thank you. Okay. What are the [clears throat]

downsides? I will not go into the downside except to mention that a number of things. For instance, AI a is proliferating so much that um it's information slow surveillance

capability, communication and the like are all affected in a particular way. Cyber crime is intensifying with sophisticated hackers. They're using advanced a tool to penetrate fragile

defenses of corporate entities and citizens. So these are downsides. So once you have completed the downsides and upsides, I will now turn to an important thing. The newest concern

relates to copyright which is also an IPR. Generative AI allows people to create images, pros and soundbased prompts. Artists and creative persons are calling AI as vampirical, not

empirical, vampirical because it scrapes pre-existing content for training. So that's a big area where copyright is coming into the picture. A has its own problems. Now I'll skip most

of these things except to say that there is what is known as balance required between baneful and beneficial impact of a it has got good and bad. How do you balance them? For which India is

in the forefront. It is now making in every way in every industry a digital transformation being propelled. There's a large growing high-tech workforce and increasing foreign investments in the

context of real time experience. The rapid development integration of AI present a series of challenges but we have to do it now. There are some acts like information technology act,

information technology rules and data protection privacy rate acts and all that. All that will definitely address some AI problems but not all. I would say it's not an opensh shut case where

these laws which are extract today available can take care of all AI downsides. Some of them will not be in that context. Do we require a new law? We have existing laws. We can deal with

it to some extent. But the stance of India is as quot mentioned by minister for electronics and IT Mr. Sh a Ashini Vishna the world is looking at India as a potential leader in

developing this new model in contrast to the legal approach followed he says don't have a legal approach have a techal approach there technology will be fully in the picture to have a legal par

paradigm so that's what he said now I will skip all this about a mission one word India has taken up a mission which is also mentioned mentioned in the brochure here it is safety is one of the

pillars of India's a mission it's campaign to develop technologies for safety detecting deep fakes biases unlearning models etc so this is what it's going to do now I'll conclude by

saying that there are ladies and gentlemen kindly listen to me for one minute on this there are five broad principles allah trips allah

IPRs and AI. Number one, trips agreement as you know is a W2 agreement. Trips agreement should not be allowed to trip public interest. Where public interest is involved, trips cannot have the last

say. It should be the public interest should have the last say. Number two, patient there is people who are sick. Patient interests need to trump patent interests. Patients are more important

than patents. So when I say to trump patent interest I am not referring to Donald Trump. Now three in public good private respects must be final. Four protect

innovation namely IPRs but remember IPR law must have their say but ant competition must have its way. IPS can have their say but competition must have its final way. And finally, gentlemen,

ladies and gentlemen, in formulating a new law, AI law, better to follow a Latin maxim, Latin saying fina lente, which means hazen slowly. Do your law slowly, gradually, and do it well, but

don't rush into it. go step by step and you'll develop yourself very well as a country. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much uh Dr. Chakravarti. Um so now we can we can

officially start the panel. We have uh a number of panelists and we have 34 minutes. So we have to be really really brief and uh uh we we should uh uh first first question. So the way I want to do

this is to first ask a question for everybody. So one by one they will uh say uh their uh what what they think about this and then we'll have a couple of questions that are meant for

individuals. Uh and then finally uh a common question for everybody else. Uh so we are running against time here. So the first question I will start with uh you uh and uh but uh then we'll go to

the others. uh what are the major IP related challenges for uh AI training and AI generated uh content uh and uh you know uh what are the who who owns the uh IP and uh what to do with the

data uh rights and and uh what about the uh generated outputs who who owns them. Um so first of all I just want to thank um everyone for putting together such a wonderful conference um and IBM is

really thrilled to be here and part of these important conversations about the US India partnership around AI. I think the way I would think about your question maybe a little differently and

that's to focus on the importance of um creating an environment where you can accelerate innovation and you can democratize even innovation leveraging things like open source. So when I think

about open source um Dr. Shakra Vartzi. Um he mentioned looking at it like um a marriage, looking at it like a bride and a groom. And I think the real benefit is to think about it um in a very balanced

way. uh what you want to do with uh with open source is uh make sure that you have the foundation of openness and transparency but also make sure on the back end that you embed in your IP laws

and your IP framework uh the opportunity to make sure that downstream creation is protected. So for IBM um we've long since been uh invested in open source uh as a as a foundation. Our granite family

of foundation models are recognized as the most transparent in the world and they're really based on things like trust auditability but it also leverages and leans into

collaboration and that's really what's important as we think about how to accelerate innovation in India is making sure that governments and particularly regulated sectors have the benefit of

accelerated in innovation at the same time they have the benefit of IP protections. So we heard yesterday Prime Minister Modi acknowledge that India is now the third largest source of um of

startups and this is particularly important when you think about open source um startups can really leverage um uh the infrastructure of open source models without reinventing the wheel. So

when you think about researchers, when you think about public institutions and startup companies, that's really where the benefit resides is just being able to build on on top of something without

reinventing the wheel. So as long as I um India's IP frameworks and laws evolve in a way that allows creation to leverage open- source models and technology all while not letting it spin

out of control and become a free-for-all, this can be a competitive advantage. &gt;&gt; Thank you. and so uh I'll go to Rajni. &gt;&gt; No, first of all, thank you for having

me and let's get straight to the question. I know this is a question if you have to start talking about challenges, I think we can spend the whole hour that we don't want to do,

right? Um you know, I've worked with multiple GCC's and GCC's today as they are trying to find their footing in AI. Uh one thing is very very clear. I think we all know that uh the wild west is

over. We have to start thinking about ownership, right? And the biggest challenge me as a AI leader is to and I know the AI potential, right? I know it has incredible potential, but the

challenge is how do I quantify ROI because that's what everybody is asking from me as a AI leader. And if you think about from a quantification perspective, if you if you don't even know if you own

it, how do you even you know estimate a value that is coming out of out of it? So the whole whole link problem I call it as the ownership value link problem. There are multiple hurdles which are not

letting me come to a good ROI value that I can showcase. Right? And and if I have to just give a few examples of those ROI challenges which are of course linked to the ownership.

The number one will be the whole quality trap. We are using AI to actually train AI model the synthetic data right maybe in few years that model will collapse and you'll probably end up in two

situation. Number one is either your model is very noisy or your model is very less volatile. Um noisy example is you know AI we love personalized recommendation. So every one is getting

their personalized recommendation. If each of these personalized recommendation if you collect it together build a master data maybe the AI will not be able to find any pattern.

It just becomes a noise. On the other side every consumer behavior is changing so fast. If you use old AI data to train new AI model it won't be able to understand what's happening today. You

know our behavior digital footprint before COVID after COVID very different digital footprint after these cyber attacks the financial attacks that are happening is very different and maybe

our footprint digital footprint after this AI summit will be very very different right so everything is changing fast and it's creating a recursive a secondary order AI risk for

us second is the model and infra is expensive you know I have to spend so much of money in building model and ensuring you know I'm paying that monthly rent for the infra and if you

ask me today will I be able to do this consistently for all my customers going forward I don't have an answer and if I don't have a long-term answer of the cost and risk I cannot associate a value

around it the third one I think this is it gets little scary uh from all of us uh side is some of these attacks I don't know If you all know the IP injection attack, there are reverse engineing

prompt attacks that are happening. Those are actually real, you know, uh it's probably not attack, it's IP heist, right? So I don't know if I own the data. I have to pay a lot of money on

legal and risk costs. The infra, you know, cost is very very high and whatever I have, I know it's not safe. So calculating that ROI is a big challenge for me.

Thank you uh Sabine. &gt;&gt; So I'm going to pick up on something that um you know our speaker and also you just mentioned too which is you know in the AI era IP is digital repub global

and globally distributed. We know that and legal recognition alone just really isn't enough in this environment and enforcement now is really what requires a lot more of the I think innovation

piece in the legal regime and we just have not focused on that a lot you know as a cyber security provider first of all rapid 7 is so excited on kind of the AI summit and to be able to bring that

thread along in this arena because again securing our digital foundations without that trust is not built and you can't innovate on these models As much as India has really been a

pioneer in terms of thinking about again the digital public infrastructure with regards to AI models, the reality of it is is that when it comes to enforcement, the line between using cyber techniques

and IP enforcement is still very blurry when it comes to the legal versus then thinking about who are the analysts that are doing that work. And this is I think a really um neglected area. We need a

lot more sort of co-branding I think between the legal side of the house and sort of thinking about what is new in this area and one thing that I think India and the US can work a lot on is

thinking about watermarking, provenence tracking and automated infringement detection. I think we really need to work on these areas together and are going to be the new frontiers not just

innovation for the sake of again thinking about what we usually think about in terms of whether we're using synthetic data or we're using you know as you were saying earlier to me you

know is it a song or something that you've generated or you know a novel with AI but really to even think about how do we from a traditional where we are as a mental model and legal

frameworks what is it that can actually get us grounded in whether or not we can even find who the owner is to begin with. I think those tools are really super antiquated and we need to do more

in this area. &gt;&gt; Great. Thank you. Uh Nathan, &gt;&gt; good morning. Um my governing thought is that um AI is changing so dramatically that um our traditional thinking around

IP and IP frameworks I think is is quite u limited. I don't think uh uh see with with AI fundamentally what's happening is that data insights and intelligence itself which traditionally all three

were scarce are becoming abundant they're becoming infinite with what what AI and in particular Genai has done is that it has brought the data of the world especially

unstructured data into the public domain into the public domain that this is a this is a quite a remarkable thing that has happened. So in that in in a world as we are as we are moving from a data

and intelligence scarce word to a data and intelligence abundant world how can you say that somebody owns it? How can you say somebody owns it? Because it is really really coming in the public

domain. It's kind of at a at a level this is like universal consciousness. Okay. If I take a metaphysical you know equivalence to this who owns it you know it is there is lot more of the

collective here. So we we keep on asking a lot of traditional questions which are based on traditional management frameworks around who owns it and blah blah blah. The the reality is that there

is no one person. This is a collective. So I think that's the first point I I would like to submit that there is a need to even rethink of the concept of IP and what really we are dealing with

because we are we are dealing with a historical shift of the nature of information and intelligence. The second point I would make is that when we when we think about AI, it is not one thing

you know we there is a very uh very kind of lazy equivalence that we begin to make all problems equal AI all AI equal to gen AI that is not the case there is geni which is of course you know that's

what has exploded on us over the last 3 four years and that is where you know we are talking about the universal data but on top On top of that there is the enterprise layer. Most of work that you

know I do you know we do as ino is at that enterprise layer you know where you know you do have the notion of proprietary data proprietary models you know proprietary methods and then on top

of that increasingly there is the individual layer and you're talking and you have the notion of individual data. So I would submit that we would need to think about the different layers

differently. I think the macro layer or the geni layer I think is you know it's going to be very difficult to apply any kind of real restrictive IP. It's not really controllable from my perspective.

Enterprise data is that's where a lot of that proprietary models or proprietary knowledge resides. That is going to become even more critical. But it is going to be quality

over quantity. It is going to be a fraction a fraction. Maybe it is 1% maybe it is less percent of all the data and and models that you're talking about. But they are going to be the

differentiator. They are going to be the competitive advantage. It's like a bowl of soup in which you put a you put a just a pinch of salt but that gives the taste. So that it is going to be that

order of magnitude but terribly important. So the notion of proprietary knowledge at the enterprise level will become extremely important. And the third level the individual level that's

what where I actually worry the most. That is you know because I think that's where the the individual data privacy I think is a big big issue. uh and I've been talking about it you know you know

for the last couple of years that look when we sign up for any forget AI but any any application we sign some kind of a waiver or some kind of an agreement who reads that who reads that so why

should the individual be subjected to something you know which they are they are opting to to to kind of use it without real awareness of it whereas almost any other product out there, a

car or whatever when you buy that it is very clear what you're signing up for. So I think the the need for for for international for global uh you know standards data privacy standards for

individual use is very important. So that that's where I would summarize that we are talking at three different levels you know we should disagregate that what are we really talking about

when we say AI the macro or the geni level very difficult to control this is becoming like a collective asset enterprise very important that's where the notion of proprietary knowledge is

very important individual level that's where there really really needs to be a lot of focus effort around establishing international data privacy norms Thank you. Uh I just want to say that uh

we have all become products for many of these uh companies and and you brought it out very well. So uh next question uh next uh for the for this challenge question uh Shardul uh

I think the first issue in my view uh which needs to be addressed is what is the question that we are we are considering. The DPI had proposed a mandatory blanket

license where AI developers pay royalties into a central fund upon commercialization with rates set by the government committee. Right holders cannot opt out.

NASCOM had expressed strong views on the paper primarily opposing this proposal and it takes a view that there should be an exemption or an exception in the copyright act for text and data mining

for training AI models. It views mandatory licensing as a burden that could hinder AI's innovation in India. The exception would allow for AI models to be trained lawfully without

payment. This position is similar to frameworks in Japan, Singapore and the EU with an opt out right. Now what has happened in the in the uh context in terms of AI training and the

kinds of information that is available? You have registered rights, you have personal rights and you have other rights. So there would be three types of licenses which would be required if AI

has to be freely available divorced of who is the current right holder and who is in the registry of right holders. So that is the primary question as to whether you are in a nonregulated sit

situation because AI does not deal with generative data. Uh and and that's an exclusion uh which you have to overcome in order that a marriage between AI rights and IP rights is worked out. The

question is what are the major IP related challenges faced in AI training and through AI generated outputs. So we have to focus on the major IP related challenges. So what are the IP related

challenges that arise? The question would be firstly the distinction between fair dealing and fair use. The matter is subjudice in the Delhi High Court in the case of uh uh ANI versus OpenAI.

The issue has to be decided as to who has the authorship, ownership and liability because that is unressed. It is not an issue which is today clear and whether a corporate ownership is valid

itself is a open issue under the copyright act and the patent rights. And then you have the question which is again an open issue of personality rights because the courts have stepped

into this area where new rights and new wrongs have been developed uh concerning personality rights. So unless and until you really create that opening in the uh copyright act by providing a legislative

exception to the principle of allowing text and data mining. you you cannot really override the AI rights because people have built those rights in expectation of a future income.

&gt;&gt; Thank you uh Jennifer. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much and thank you to NASCOM for convening this uh important panel. Um, I'm Jennifer Mulveni with Adobe and I uh am responsible for our

government relations and public policy interactions in APEC, which is a very exciting place to be right now given AI. Um, but Natine, you hit on a really good point around generative AI versus AI

generally. And you know, anyone who's used Photoshop for as long as it's been around has been using AI longer than sort of the recent um explosion in the AI generative AI hype recently. And

that's something that we have been considering for a long time in our positioning and how we approach governments. So I don't I don't think there's a government in the world right

now that is not trying to figure out this balance of how to protect innovation or advance innovation while also protecting uh copyright and intellectual property rules and it's

it's a tough one. I really don't envy policy makers in this space. um they have various stakeholders that they have to look at and I think the one that uh Adobe spends the most time in is the

creative sector given that creativity is in our DNA and we uh consider ourselves to be the most creative company in the world. Um artists everywhere uh rely on our tools to um advance their trade and

and support their livelihood and understandably they are concerned with what uh generative AI means for their future and for livelihood in terms of uh what data can be trained on and what are

the rules around outputs etc. Uh we have a couple of ideas on that front that we have promoted uh most recently in our um submission to the Indian government as it looks at its copyright rules. And one

is uh really focusing on the output and and what is it that is actually going to make a difference in terms of how creatives are um uh supported in this new AI world. One of the things that we

have mentioned uh and we think this is really important is that creatives when they are using an AI tool such as an Adobe creative software or any other type of tool they should have uh the

ability to opt out and say that I do not want my work to be trained on. Um and within Adobe's tools we actually allow that through um Sabine I think you mentioned uh content credentials and

provenance. So the the provenence tools that we have in our in our um products allow an artist to say or a creative or a marketer to say I don't want my work to be trained on. Now the question is

whether or not that's going to be honored. Right? It's one thing to say this is what I want but is this actually going to be something that's going to be uh taken into consideration when that

work goes through its its cycle posted to social media etc. And we actually think that governments should look at how that can be honored and and should that be enforced if someone makes that

claim. Secondly, um you talked um Dr. Shadul about uh rights and and different types of rights. And one right that we think is is sort of noticeably absent from a lot of um IP uh frameworks and

laws around the world is uh the uh impersonation right or the ability for a a creative to take a right of action if they feel like their uh personality or their work has been intentionally um

ripped off uh for e economic gain. So that's something we have uh looked at. We've proposed that here in the in the Indian context of looking at these rules. Uh there's some legislation

that's been considered in the United States around this uh that would I think create a new right for people that feel like their livelihood is being seriously undermined. So I think there are ways to

at least have a dialogue around this difficult balance of promoting innovation and protecting intellectual property rights and Adobe is really happy to be at the center of that

discussion. So thank you for the session here today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So uh thank you uh all uh you know all of you for u you know bringing out some of the major challenges.

Unfortunately we have 11 minutes and we have uh a lot of more questions. In fact this kind of topic requires multi-day workshop not a 50-minut uh you know uh thing. uh regarding this uh recently

there is a Chinese app that is creating uh lifelike Hollywood uh movie clips with real Hollywood actor uh personas right question is you know uh how legal it is and I think uh these kind of

things are going to uh happen more and more right so and uh this is the kind of thing that we are all very worried about uh but uh the one thing that in India we are worried about and I think uh I'll

start with Jennifer is that uh uh startups AI startups right uh and and small businesses they are without proper legal clarity they are not going to be very confident about what they are going

to do and and even though we have a lot of startups the startups do not have a clarity as to uh if they uh build models if they build uh products you know what is the future if there would be a legal

uh problem and all that. So how do you how do you see this u you know what what can we do in the interim until we have a better understanding of the IP rights &gt;&gt; right so I go go back to what I was just

mentioning I'll just elaborate on it a bit more um I do think that uh one of the most important things is for them to be able to u go into their their trade and and feel as if they can um have that

legal framework or that legal recourse that they need. uh particularly we've given how quickly we've all talked about how quickly AI is taking off and we all know it's not a secret that mostly

speaking laws can't keep up with technology um we can barely keep up with it uh as as as people that do this on a on a regular base and understand the technology so I do think that um

countries do have to consider the existing legal frameworks what needs to be changed um on on the legal front versus letting things um be taken up by the courts as you know that's generally

the way things are taken up in the United States I think to um allow uh particularly in the I can speak most specifically to the creative sector and you're right about uh the uh the the the

entertainment and media sector here in India is certainly um going to be sensitized to this. Uh I do think that there should be a right for uh for impersonation uh like you just

mentioned. I think there should be something to be considered of what what exists and what more can be out there uh to protect artists livelihood. And then the just this right of um saying, you

know, do not do not train on my work. If I'm going to create something, regardless of whether or not it's still not clear who owns that work, whether it's they you own it or not, it's still

if I did if I did create this, I should be able to say do not trade on my work. So I think things like that, that's just a starting point. This is not something that Adobe considers to be a silver

bullet. It's not something that we think is the answer. But this dialogue of just putting some ideas on the table with startups in mind, with creatives in mind, with business in mind, I think is

really really important and I do think that most countries in the world are doing a very good job including of India of opening up that stakeholder process um and and listening to different

perspectives which I think is absolutely critical. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So Rajini, can you add to that with the institutional support? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I think I think it's and

again you know as a AI leader I I have been there I do this every day there probably five important institutional support that we can provide to startups I think number one is give us the

prevetted data come on if you already give me a prevetted clean data I'm saving 60% of my time right second help me democratize compute you know you have hundred millions of different startups

but they they you know looking for their own compute can we democratize compute so that you know we can share the cost the third one is lab to market and this is where I need universities to help us

support build products which are ready for market right all the AI research that's happening we have to start thinking about how we can directly contextualize for a business and sell in

the market right so it cannot be a AI research product it has to be a real AI product that can do go there the fourth one which I think is very very critical is future skills. Um I know uh you know

there's a high time that the law policy starts understanding code and code starts understanding law policy right so we have to start building talent using the right skill to ensure that while

they know coding while they know AI we have to ensure they know that how to build AI which is safe and trusted they understand all the laws all the policies and they are applying in their

day-to-day life so so I think the the whole fundamental of in institutional support is it should not create a speed bump. It should actually create like a pitch curve so that if we face any

challenges you know the startup should be able to get a you know get a smooth curve or smooth movement from there not spinning out. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh so uh next question is for

an you you spoke about IBM's commitment to open source but open source uh also um you know is kind of IP sovereignity these things are kind of uh against uh you know using open source all the time

for all kinds of products. So how do you balance this uh two? So um I want to pick up on a couple of things that have been said so far um and intersect that with this notion of

governance because open sources there's just there is a balance right between um innovation and creativity borrowing the underlying models and then building protections for what's created on top

but governance is incredibly important as a partner to the IP legal framework and there are already the good news right is that I think India is already thinking about um governance borrowing

from uh frameworks like uh Singapore's AI verify and NIST's framework. They're already borrowing from things like that as they think about how to embed more governance and ethics into the models

from an operational standpoint. But what I would um say that echoes some of the things that other people have already mentioned is the importance of when you think about the principles in AI

governance, you've got you know sort of transparency, explanability, but you also now have an increasingly um uh more spoken about principle around auditability. So auditability I think

also starts to address some of the questions about if you build a consent feature into the how do I know that you've honored my consent? If you are trying to trace ownership for when you

think about it from the legal standpoint, enforcement, how do I know, you know, who owns what? And so auditability is um an increasingly important element of AI governance that

intersects really nicely with um with IP legal. And so whether it's open source or whatever type of framework um when you think about governance, that's an important uh portion of the

conversation. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So um I would like to ask uh Sabine about what L licensing consent and compensation mechanism uh should we adopt.

&gt;&gt; Sure. I mean I'm happy to talk about it. Um I think at the end of the day look like there is going to be I think a little bit and you Nathan sort of talked about this. I think we have to really

reconceptualize licensing and thinking about what is it that we're actually doing in terms of the core set of things that is the product on top and what part of this is

open commons as we talk about open source um you know India's leading when it comes to kind of again these models where they should be sort of plugandplay there's a core set of sort of data that

is universal commons and then after that it's licensing depending on what use you're using it for is it niche is it for the larger public good is it specific you know sectors that actually

can pay or play and I think we have to really think about this again from a place of what is expected and what is trusted the other piece to your point on licensing is I think you have to kind of

caveat mour to be honest I think at the end of the day there is just some data models integritywise that have to be sort of think thought about as just public use and when it comes to then

licensing or paying for that I think that's a trade-off that countries have to make in terms of what are you producing on top of that so I think it's a complex question about you know again

the model that you're thinking about which and you know the this this whole panel is about really thinking about I think India's approach towards these national assets and if you're thinking

about it as a as a national construct you know then licensing becomes a little bit more of a of a more deeper question around who should have access, how should that access be uh developed? Do

you subsidize that for then universities and other people that are going to build innovation on top of it? Are you going to then get that money back from other people that are then commoditizing it?

So, I think there's a little bit more complexity there with the AI overlay just because again data becomes ubiquitous, but you want a common set that's auditable, trust, trustworthy

that we need to think about. And I think one thing you've also uh sort of maybe is is an undertone here is with licensing and other things we also have to think about the safety element here,

the security element. You're paying for that data to stay integrous. And uh I think here we haven't heard a lot about sort of again making that sort of available. So those are some things that

I would point out as you're thinking about a new regime with what we've all talked about. Those are some things that I would hope can be open for discussion as we're thinking about again publics

licensing and who pays ultimately the cost for that. Thank you. Uh we have 1 minute left so I'll ask Shahzul to uh finish his thoughts. He already spoke about legality and uh uh you know data

set uh rights uh already a little bit but we can finish off with that. I think uh endemic to this whole debate, it's about making a choice. What you're saying is that the government has to

make a choice as to whether it embeds a statutory or a constitutional right in relation to what is generic and what is therefore allowable as either mass copying or as a process which really

impedes on personal rights or general commercial. Commercial of course is a different proposition. So you are effectively asking the government to add an exception to section 52 from the

three exceptions which are stated there to exclude text and data mining in relation to what is an what is a wrong in relation to copyright. Section 52 basically spells out what is the right

of intervention through courts where you can stop something from happening. And what is today absent is the right to intervene when you are to make mass copies and when you have to overlay a

software or an application which has that kind of proprietariness or copyright. This is the leap of faith that the government is asked to do because you are creating a new right

from a non-existent right and that is premised on the basis that all rights which are today registered under the copyright act are effectively not going to stop the process of data and text uh

text and data mining so as to interfere in the buildup of a uh system which is universal. So that is the debate which is faced by the government. Here you have the people

who have constructed uh large networks which have effectively uh scraped or crawled through all data irrespective of whether it is copyrighted data or it is personal data

or whether it is uh you know non-personal data that is today in the control and custody of the LLMs. Now you're basically saying is I don't have a right. That's where the GCC's and

the small uh you know operators have effectively made their say that if we are to enter the market we don't know whether there is a pri prior or pre-existing copyright which will stop

us. So you have effectively to first and foremost drecognize all those rights which are general and where there's a personal whether where there is a general use in relation to those rights

because that right interferes in the buildup of an LLM model. After you address this right by creating the exception in section 52, you are saying give me a freedom to develop a

proprietary software over and above that and let me have the rights where I basically can use that without payment of royalties to anybody. All prior owners of that uh of that copyright

don't get any revenue in relation to the uh right which is embedded by law. So this is the dilemma which government faces. Government effectively is asked to make a policy decision that negate

the rights at the base. Negate the rights which have been created over time. Make it an open field and let me build on it because that's the only way large

commerce can happen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh we are out of time but I will ask uh if Nin wants to add some I'll give him the last word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. See the topic is um how should

India think about IP and as a national asset. See I'll keep it very brief. I would say less is more. Less is more. I I think uh friend from Adobe like you know I think she laid it out well. See

there is a balance between innovation and protection. I think we are at at that stage in our AI journey where the overwhelming imperative is innovation. overwhelming imperative and we are

lagging in that let's also call that out okay you know beyond all the chest thumping so we we need like heavy focus on that now of course for innovation IP protection is also a necessary guardrail

for that we should focus on what are the obvious extreme cases you talked about deep fakes or or impersonification you know there is about the enterprise level you know proprietary knowledge

protection there is consumer data privacy perhaps Perhaps there are five 10 specific issues that need to be addressed which we should address but we this should not be the topic number one.

It should not be the topic number one you know because the more we talk about it we find excuses not to do things and not to push on innovation. And I think that's what I would submit. Yes, this is

very important but less is more. Let's be surgical. I think Shardul laid it out very nicely that there are some very specific issues that have to be addressed at a foundational level. We

should do that but let's put our energy and focus where it really should be put which is innovation and growth. &gt;&gt; All right. So the uh debate continues but uh I think innovation is the

priority as Nathan has laid out. So uh we'll stop here. This is a topic that needs to be discussed even a lot more and uh a lot more elaborately but uh it's a start. So so thank I thank all

the panelists for their time and uh for clarity of thought that they have expressed. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you everyone. As a token of gratitude, NASCOM will be planting 10

trees for each speaker and we'll be sharing digital certificates for it soon. Thank you everyone. Yes. &gt;&gt; And I'll also request to get speakers

moment here. Thank you.
