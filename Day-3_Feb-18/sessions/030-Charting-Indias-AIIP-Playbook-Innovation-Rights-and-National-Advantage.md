## 📝 Summary

From AI-generated content and code to foundation models, traditional boundaries of authorship, inventorship, and ownership are increasingly contested as jurisdictions adapt their intellectual property regimes. The IndiaAI Mission positions indigenous datasets, models, and compute infrastructure as strategic national assets for innovation, exports, and long-term economic growth. Without a future-ready AI–IP framework, India risks legal uncertainty that could constrain innovation and investment. This session situates AI–IP policy within the vision of Viksit Bharat, linking science and innovation, safe and trusted AI, and AI-led economic growth and social good.
