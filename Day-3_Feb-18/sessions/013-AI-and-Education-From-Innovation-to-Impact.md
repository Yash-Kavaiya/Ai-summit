## 📝 Transcript

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, distinguished quest. Uh we are here at uh a global AI summit to speak about one of the most intriguing one of the most important and one of the most impactful

topics in the air in 2026. It's using adopting utilizing and mitigating also the risks of utilizing and using AI in the field of education. We know the enormous amount of pressure

which education systems globally have and the new technologies are delivering a promise. But in the same time parallel to that a number of unanswered questions which is

very natural because we are witnessing a escalating path and speed of the technology where we have no clue from the technology development perspective what will be the functionality of those

tools in six months time in 9 months time. However, education system needs to be here for 5 years, for 10 years, for 25 years and make sure that the system and

engine is delivering the best result. Without further ado, I would like to kick off with our uh event today and give a floor for opening remarks to his excellency president of Republic of

Estonia, Mr. Alaris. Please, [applause] ladies and gentlemen, AI has already arrived in our schools. Students and teachers are using AI on a

daily basis, often more ready than the education system is able to respond to it. The question therefore is not whether AI is used but whether it is used knowingly, critically and

responsibly by everyone, not only by most techsavvy. In Estonia, we view data literacy and digital literacy as the foundations of our democracy, economy, and security.

They are not merely narrow IT competences but a new basic levels of skills enabling people to understand how decisions are made, how data used and what their rights are in the digital

environment. That is why Estonia is launching Estonia's AI leap, a national push to bring practical AI skills and new learning tools into education at speed

and at scale. Our aim is for the majority of our population to gain basic AI skills and for at least half to do so to an international intermediate level. We introduce AI based tools in education

but are fully aware that technology in itself does not change education people do. That is why we are systematically investing in digital competence for teachers in the training school leaders

and in lifelong learning. Our approach is all encompassing from primary education to further training. Teachers are not just technology users but agents of digital chains who decide

whether innovation becomes real improvement. Just as we have built our digital governance around serving the citizens, we are building AI use in education

around serving learning. Alongside implementation, we are launching a research research program to investigate the impact of our AI leap. We need to know AI's effect on learning

outcomes, equity, teacher workload, digital well-being, and the quality of classroom practice. We need evidence on what works, for whom, and under what conditions. Only then we can improve

fast and share what we learn internationally. At the same time, the use of AI education must be transparent and ethical. Learners need to know when AI

is being used, understand what is what it can do, what it cannot do, and what risks it carries. Transparency builds trust and trust generates willingness to learn and

experiment. What it means is practical terms in Estonia is the development of central platform for digital training, the creation of digital academy and

availability of uniform learning materials. Our aim is for everyone regardless of the age or background to be able to find a way to foster a digital literacy that works for them.

And because Estonia is a small language space, we know AI can do of two things. It can marginalize languages and cultures or it can strengthen them. We support small language models, open

language data and local solutions. The digital future must be multilingual language and truly diverse. In the AI era, it is not how smart machines are that matters most, but how smart the

people who use them are. Education is the key to this. As president of the UNICEF executive report this year, Estonia is deeply committed to advancing the global conversation on AI and

education. For this reason, we are especially pleased to be co-hosting this event with UNICEF and to be hearing the perspectives of representatives from Kenya, Finland, and

Estonia. Thank you very much for attention. Thank you so much. We know that number of countries are doing currently the uh practice practical works in order to

start delivering AI at education. However, the global multilateral environment also to share their experiences and work with a different learning outcomes is as important as

possible. I'm most happy to have another opening remarks delivered by P loto, global director of education from UNICEF, please. Thank you, President Caris.

wonderful to be gathered here today. I want to thank Estonia for partnering with UNICEF on this discussion. And before I begin, I would like to recognize your leadership, excellency

president. What you've just shared with us, this Estonian experience is that real formula of digital transformation. You've shown us how governance, trust,

and innovation has come together. And that's a lesson we have to take forward as we continue to leap and jump with AI transforming education. Thank you so much and recognizing your leadership on

this. Um as was introduced by our master of ceremonies to speak a little bit from UNICEF's point of view as a multilateral organization that's eager to bring change for the much needed situation of

learning. For those of you who know UNICEF, you might be familiar with the fact that we have the global mandate which we proudly carry forward to advance children's rights. We work at

system level with ministries of education in over 140 countries. We operate at scale including as you know in some of the most challenging contexts around the world. We carry that

responsibility to ensure that innovation strengthens public education systems. It doesn't bypass them. It's the key to acceleration and change. Now, we are at a moment where there's so

much excitement about the potential of AI. But the other side of the page is we have a global learning crisis. We are looking at a situation where around the world a majority of 10 year

olds over 70% of 10 year olds in low and middle inome countries cannot read or understand a simple text. Juxose that with the enormous progress we're talking about in AI but where the bulk of the

world's 10year-olds are not able to decipher a single sentence. This you know is hundreds of millions of children who are at risk of being left behind. So when we speak about AI and

education we have to talk not about marginal gains. We have to talk about how innovation can reverse structural inequity. And this is something I want to double down on.

We have had edtech for three decades. Three decades. and edtech at scale for two decades. And what have we learned from that? Devices did not create equity.

Free tools did not create equity. Connectivity did not create equity. What created equity was an ecosystem that supports teachers, that protects children, and that's accountable to

public systems. And this is where we bring together pedagogy and technology. There are roughly 70 million teachers globally.

One teacher in some countries is teaching 30 children, in other countries 60 children at one time. Teachers are a very powerful multiplier in education. They are the primary infrastructure of

equity. If AI strengthens their ability to differentiate instruction, assess progress, reduce administrative burden, we will see results at scale

immediately. If AI assumes perfect infrastructure and high digital readiness, it is going to benefit those who have advantages already. So this is where the

responsibility of our generation is very clear. No generation before us and no generation after us bears this core responsibility. We have to bridge the digital divide

before it gets wider. This is a call to action to each one of us. And the way AI is leaping forward, we also know we have a timebound window to make this possible.

On the part of UNICEF, our digital education strategy and our edtech for good initiative reflect that long-term commitment to making digital transformation equitable, safe and

importantly grounded in evidence. I want to take a moment to just go beyond the technical work because there's a much broader movement that is taking shape right across regions. We

are seeing an alignment among member states, technology leaders, development partners that we need a shared operational framework to guide how AI serves children and learning. Right now

it is quite disperate. We need a framework to bring this together. That platform is being carefully shaped with partners. And we're very pleased that you mentioned the presidency of the

executive board of UNICEF, your excellency, and playing this central leadership role in stewarding this collective agenda, ensuring that children's rights and system

strengthening and equity remain at the core. But this is not a standalone initiative. It requires a movement. A movement that brings us all together. Political commitment, industry action,

system level implementation to make it happen. And I want to leave you with three shifts that are essential to make this happen. First, no more pilots. We have to work

at a system level. We have to change and transform the system. Second, we really have to move from these performance claims, it's doing so well, to real evidence on learning outcomes. Let's get

serious. Our goal is learning outcomes. The claims are great. The PR is good, the marketing is terrific, but let's get learning outcomes. And here again, I want to double down on the most

marginalized learners. You can see equity is in our veins. And the third right now, we have too many fragmented tools. I know we are in India and we hear that every school has a different

app, a different product. It's a lot of fragmented tools. How do we bridge together interoperable ecosystems that ministries can sustainably manage? Ministries are telling us every day

someone comes with a new proposal to them, a new idea to them. Let's try this. Let's try this. How can we help ministries bring that interoperability together? And I say this because these

three shifts speak to all of us in the room. We have researchers, we have tech builders, we have policy makers. You know what it takes to scale. So if we design with equity in our heart from the

start, we design with the right governance model, we design with teacher innovation, we can help to close that learning gap. So in balance, we are the generation who has to get it right and

future generations are going to look to us. So let's commit with equity at the heart of what we're going to do. We are going to shape this technology before that technology shapes us. We are going

to create the consumers of the technology before the technology consumes us. And we are always going to keep at the heart and core of our work those who are at greater risk of being

left behind. Thank you so very much for this work together and looking forward to the next steps. Thank you. Thank you so much for those fantastic opening remarks.

And if I may to try to summarize those three pillars, let's focus on learning outcomes. No more small pilots, but we need to scale it and make it work for and the impact is delivered on the

ecosystem level. Those are exactly the words which match between the UNICEF goals and what has been the practice in Estonia and in many other countries. And this is what we are going to explore

throughout the next half an hour plus with our distinguished panelists. I would like to call to the stage uh panelists IO Visak CEO of a leap of Estonia. Please, Professor Petri

Muly Maki from Finland, dedicated also to Finnish Finland artificial intelligence uh development and [clears throat] Madame Mary KMA uh Kenan egovernment and

digital economy uh secretary please Just checking that the mics are working and also just checking that everybody can see the members of panel. And uh wow uh first reflections back from those

opening remarks and keynotes and uh and there was one thing in the very heart which is no more pilots but countrywide scaling and uh and that might take time. However, IO exactly pretty much one year

ago, president of Estonia was preparing for his annual speech for Independence Day of Estonia. And it was the first time one year ago when the AI leap became a

matter of subject in the call of the speech of the president on the independence day and now the country has rolled out an artificial intelligence virtually in all the schools in Estonia.

Can you elaborate a little bit what in your view has happened during one year and what were the key success factors why in virtually less than one year time one country can deliver AI to all the

schools? &gt;&gt; First of all thank you uh thank thank you also for the very good uh beginning speeches. Uh yeah, I would say that uh one of the

main uh successes &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; uh has been uh the understanding that we are not doing it only for a region in some part of Estonia but we are doing

everywhere in Estonia at the same time. So uh we give the equal opportunity to all the schools uh the same way uh the schools can opt in uh but we but they of course they can opt out also but all of

the schools uh in all the Estonian high schools opted in because it also meant that we are providing them not only with the tools but we are also providing them with the educational uh training uh

that's needed for the culture to change inside the high schools also and I would say that that is sort of one of the hardest tasks. Uh we have we already see some positive results from that but the

culture shift inside the school uh this is something that takes some time. I think another part of it is not only the uh schools part when it comes to uh the high schools in Estonia but also I would

say the general understanding that this is a cooperation not only uh by the ministry of education and research but it's a whole nation uh question. So we have a lot of uh Estonian companies who

have uh come behind uh behind our initiative and are supporting uh the the initiative in its first uh years. So so in that sense uh I think Estonia has had its uh previous success story with the

Drahip or the Tiger Leap program. Uh I understand that we we have to be careful with that word in here sometimes. uh but uh in in other otherwise I would say that uh this program the previous

programs have been very successful uh and it means that the public has generally quite a huge trust towards these kind of initiatives. So this trust still carries on but uh I would say even

now inside the school uh a lot of the students while we were piloting our version of the tools uh the students themselves said that they trust our tool more because they trust it. So there's a

general trust towards the system also. So I would say that the first part is trust building. uh if you have the trust then uh people will follow also but of course uh you can't break the trust in

that that sense that you still have to deliver also and and that's why we have a a pretty pretty immense pedagogical uh plan behind it. So it's a pedagogical program that's supported by technology

not the technological program supported by pedagogy. So we have to get the we have to get that part right also. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. In a nutshell in

Estonia all schools are online already for good 20 plus years. All teachers have been used to use it within the schools. The market has been divided between

Microsoft and Google in terms of the core infrastructure being used at the school level and what Estonia has done on top of that delivering the learning outcomes in

strong national language model. The special custom GPT from OpenAI has been developed for the learning outcomes delivery assisting teachers and assisting

students not replacing students not replacing teachers. Madame Karima, uh it was highlighted also throughout the opening remarks that uh ETH has been here for three decades

at scale two decades. Yet it's not technology that delivers learning outcomes. It's an ecosystem. It's a school level. It's a teacher. It's a classroom practice level.

What have been your experiences in utilizing and using digital technologies to amplify that classroom level, teachers level and ecosystem level practices in Kenya.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Uh push on. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you very much. Um thank you your excellency the president. very good

remarks that are thoughtprovoking and I think we look up to Estonia for the many experiences uh that you've had. Um for Kenya I think it is high time and we've realized that without embracing

technology we will be left behind and therefore we've been deliberate and we've been able to realize that really if there exists an infrastructure that is stable that is

scalable is the teacher because you can find limited connectivity, you can find limited devices, but you'll always find a teacher in a

class. And therefore, uh, looking up to Estonia, I think what we really want to do differently and we've started doing is to make sure that AI literacy for the teachers come first. Why?

because we realize that if we empower the teacher then there will be clear ethical AI use because it is in the classroom that it all starts. So uh we are also making sure that even

as the teacher we empower the teacher we can ensure that that teacher can be able to protect and safeguard the students and that is a child because without empowering the teacher then we will

realize there will be a lot of biasness there will be a lot of misuse of technology. Again, we are looking at making sure that we are not substituting the teacher

and we've said that and we found that if we educate the teacher, the teacher is the multiplier because the teacher you educate the teacher, you empower the teacher, then

we have more than 100 students who can be supported by by an AI enabled uh teacher. So we are saying that uh AI should really be an enabler to the teacher to support the teacher to do

what they know best but in a more efficient manner. And with the use of AI then you are able to relieve the teacher from doing the routine things and concentrate in really and holding this

uh student and making sure that they can be able to support uh the students well. Of course uh as we also embrace technology it is not coming without challenges because you'll find

that uh AI based solutions are heavy on compute but we are saying that in Kenya we want to embrace models we want to embrace systems that can be able to with withstand or thrive in low bandwidth or

even work offline where there is no connectivity. So that there is continuity because you realize as you move the country into depending on technology then you have to ensure that

that technology is available 24/7 because you cannot afford to have um an education system relying on technology and then you don't have connectivity, you don't have light uh power and we

don't want really technology to be a major exclusion tool. So therefore, we have to make sure that there is inclusivity.

Again, I want to echo what um the UNICEF um leader said that for sure the use of AI has to be measurable and therefore monitoring and evolution is key. We have to measure what is the

impact. Are we really getting the value of what we are investing in? And one thing that I don't want to forget is you know the AI there's nothing artificial about intelligence.

It is coming to amplify the intelligence and therefore we should not fear to embrace technology because we in Kenya with partnership with UNICEF and Mastercard we want to make sure we

use AI for equalization that for the people who have been excluded for years that we can use technology to bring them on board so that nobody is left behind. Thank you.

Thank you so much. In a sense, once again, we can witness the core truth teacher centric emerging technologies and the models which could be used and utilized not only in a high bandwidth

high compute physical environments but also making sure that it's available globally independent on the technical ecosystem and the teachers comes first. Thank you so much. Uh, Professor Müller,

quite a number of national initiatives are at the moment uh being uh stacked by the fact that uh governments, institutions claim to say that small nations, small

countries can't deliver and adopt because it's only a game of a two big countries and fistful of a global tech companies and we have no choice

as a small countries except rejecting their value offer or going with the value offer. In Finland, lot of attention is put also to the resilience and to the national AI infrastructure

and core models. Could you share a little bit about the current path and the way forward which Finland is thinking about national level sovereign technologies which could be

used and utilized also in the case of environmental applications. &gt;&gt; Yes. So uh thank you thank you for having me here. Um uh the I think that's the very central question is like who is

developing AI at the moment and uh somebody said like do we really have only two alternatives that it's the hyperscalers big tech who build it for commercial purposes or for commercial

incentives or is it countries who lead this and they maybe may have some kind of surveillance and geopolic ical ambitions while I guess we all we would like to have AI based products and

services that are useful for everybody and uh still they respect human rights and they are safe to use and we understand how they are going to be used. So um as an example like uh there

are many global initiatives that try to also here uh I have seen many people talking about this like let's try to build a kind of a common movement that we can build AI together uh pulling

small languages together building large AI infrastructures together in this kind of a third path But it's still we are still far from that. uh uh I heard I learned in in UN that uh there are

several really well-meaning organizations like well the summit series is one there's GPI there's AI for good Hiroshima process and several other initiatives that are really meaning well

they all have good intentions but the analysis that was done by the secretary as in in UN was that UN has if I remember right 193 countries in these global initiatives that mean well seven

countries are in all of them and 119 countries are in none of them this cannot continue I mean like it it's really this digital divide becoming an even deeper AI that's that's going to

happen unless we now tackle this problem and do something &gt;&gt; thank you so much the call really for recognizing the importance from the central government perspective to

participate in the global AI dialogue is probably something also which is uh uh being taking place right now here in in Delhi on the AI summit where so many institutions organizations and

governments are present and I believe most of the governments have recognized that 2026 is a year is a year to focus on actions and adoption. I would like to ask all the panelists

really about the same motif. Is 2026 the year of focusing on adoption or should we still wait for another year or two

and then start making AI something which is integrated to the fabric of our societies? Well, Eva, let's start with you. I see you are so intrigued already by that

question. Is 2026 a year? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it is a year. [laughter] But I I I would say that uh in a lot of ways uh we are we are already doing it anyway. I think uh doing nothing has

never been a good strategy. uh this kind of waiting out game uh doesn't really work especially in a school environment where a lot of really bad

uh ways on how students can work with this technology will just get more entrenched uh and they will they will keep using these kind of methods they they kind of learn these methods and

then they will just continue using it. So I would say that this kind of a interruption uh interruption has to happen and this interruption has to be I'm I'm very very much in the same line

that it it comes down to teachers it comes down to supporting teachers and at the same time I think one of the key aims also is to make sure that uh we work with companies even when we talk

about these big global players uh in this world we we still as governments as uh uh organizations affiliated with one or another government uh or country. We have to make sure that these uh

companies also provide the technology which is meant for the country's education system not for the vision of these companies idea of education. So, so that is one of the core philosophies

that we have to always keep in mind that the country's education systems are the sers of what's going to happen. Uh it shouldn't be the tech. So we have been thus far very happy with our partners.

Uh so this year we have been working with both Google and open AAI and and uh currently our our collaboration thus far has been very very good. Uh so so there is there is possibility for that but it

also means that uh uh you have to have you have to be very frank about what you want uh when it comes to sort of is it the year of of of impact I I would say so because we also have a research

project uh happening uh from University of Tartto side in Estonia by professor Yanaru and we are also having a research partner in US from Stanford University led by uh Dr.

Sorry, professors. So, so in that sense we are measuring exactly uh the impact on on learning outcomes and Estonian education system is very knowledge heavy but we want to make sure uh that we are

only not focusing on on knowledge but we are also focusing on on on do can these tools be supportive of learning skills. So so that students ask more on on why they are really learning. uh and I would

say that in general if by 2026 the countries haven't sort of understood that there's a huge mirror in front of them that that this I would say that AI is both a good and bad technology for

education system and and I would say that one of the the bad one of the bad reasons is a very good reason it's really disruptive to a lot of uh very bad methods that are still entrenched in

in our teaching practices also so I would say that every education system kind of has has to look into the mirror and ask is there really point doing the stuff that I've been doing for the last

20 years is there any point to continue doing it like that or do I have to change my teaching methods do my colleagues have to change teaching methods probably yes and a lot of these

teaching methods have been the things that our educational psychologists have been saying for the last 30 years so uh that's that &gt;&gt; fantastic madame Kima is it year of

action Is it year of sitting and waiting? &gt;&gt; I would say that uh we are even late. &gt;&gt; So we have to run. I don't know whether we'll fly for us to catch up because I

think we cannot bury our heads in the sand. There's so much going on. There's so much usage of AI. Even in schools, the students go to universities. The lecturers are complaining that uh they

give assignment the research are based on AI ch tell it and it will give you. So therefore do we sit and wait for our people to use technology in a wrong way?

No, we need to up our game, position ourselves to safeguard our people in proper usage of air. Air is good. Amplified intelligence is good, but you need to put systems,

you need to put guard rails to make sure you can protect both the teacher and the student. But we should have embraced AI like yesterday because it is transformative if it is used in the

right way. And I've said that it is an equalizer. If you really sit down and take the fluency in AI, you'll understand what it can do for our

countries. So therefore, 2026, we are too late. We should have done it and we need to do it. And I like what my colleague speaker said. We need to ask ourselves the hard questions.

Is it still valid for us to do things the way we've been doing them? We need to shape up because if you look at our universities and look at the curriculum, it's no longer fitting the market. And

that's why the students are asking why should we go to school. So therefore if we don't change the way we are doing things and embrace the new way of doing things we will be left behind we'll be

left with our universities and these young people will go forward. So therefore we need to change before the students change us. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. I know that it's not

yet a common understanding. However, there is a connotation which I have been using as we go to the supermarket and on the milk there is a best before date. University degrees should have similar

best before date. Not claiming that the future is brilliant after going through my bachelor's or master's degree but you need to come back in two years time maximum in order to renew and to reskill

yourself. Uh so at university level at research level what's your point? Do you support the action or should governments wait still? Uh well maybe I have been working professionally in AI since 87.

So my perspective may be a little bit different from some of the newcomers in the field. So uh I mean and people always they ask like when is AI going to be more intelligent than a human and I

said like well that train left 50 years ago. I mean depends how you I mean they are much computers are much better in calculating things and in many things searching information they have read the

whole now the AI has read the whole whole internet and can remember everything so they can surpass us in certain tasks so uh I don't believe that uh uh if we wait for a couple of years

there will be some wonderful super omnipotent AI that will s sol solve all the problems in the world we need to, as you said it very well, we humans, this is a technology and we humans need to

solve our problems. We can use this technology to help it, but by the end of the day, it's humans building new services and products and systems for other humans. So uh and then maybe I

would like just go full ahead but like maybe just calm down a little bit among among all this hype like my favorite anecdote is that when Chachi PT was launched we had a panic meeting at our

university like oh my god what are we going to do uh AI is going to write all the essays of the students so they will learn nothing and the f first half an hour everybody was panicking

Literally people were screaming like what are we going to do? Then somebody said like wait a minute uh wasn't this possible also earlier that you could ask your fellow students to write the essay

or there are even commercial services online that you can you can buy essays. So it's just easier you push a button. But like what did we do earlier? And then the remedy was that we tried to

explain to the students that the point is not to have yet another essay in the world. The point is that you will learn how to do it. By all means utilize AI tools as much as you can but like you

need to learn something on the way. So otherwise this is not learning at all. So I would like encourage this type of mentality that maybe sometimes cool down a little bit and think like what is

really going on and what is new and what is old and uh how can we utilize this wonderful technology that is improving all the time. How can we augment humans in in what they do uh as well as

possible and who is going to do this? Because let's remember that in in particular in education if we have a system that the students use uh if it's were if it only works in well in English

that's a kind of a value statement. If if the value framework is let's say Californian uh then that's only one value framework. In other parts of the world we we have different values. So I

don't like this idea that one size fits all because it doesn't. So we we need to be very careful who develops this technology for us all. Thank you so much. Uh ladies and gentlemen, we are we

are getting closer to the very end of our panel and this session. Before we conclude, however, I have a one very quick exercise for all our three panelists.

Imagine and this is something what human can do much better. I would say compared to computers. Imagine yourself in the situation where you are in the elevator with a minister of education and

research from another country and you are and the minister says tell me what should I do with that AI? And the elevator started to go up. You have 20 seconds,

Evo. &gt;&gt; Well, I I I really liked what uh Petri said. Uh I think first of all calm down, [laughter] take it easy, take a deep breath and uh

and like first of all really think what uh what's the point of education system and uh and then I would go to yeah what what Mary said that uh there's always been teachers if they need help upskill

them uh and make sure that uh if you if you decide to provide technology make sure that you provide it in an equal manner and the elevator arrived. Ding. And

minister gets out saying thank you. Mary, what's your elevator story? &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; please use a mic. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I think my elevator story once it lands,

I'll be asking myself, how do I humanize technology? Because as uh my colleague here said, it is really asking yourself I how can I utilize

this technology to make me better to make me more efficient rather than fearing it? And I believe any technology that comes our way it has the goodnesses in it. I know um I've been in government

for the last 27 years and when technology started being used in government I remember the hold guards were like no this is a no go zone then everybody was fearing technology

but the moment we started implementing systems now people say we can't do without a technology because we started with making sure we computerized

and uh take services online. So because of the convenience that it comes with, people want to be served at their doorstep. So with AI, let's embrace it. For me, once the elevator lands, I'll

get on it and use it, but use it prudently. &gt;&gt; Super. Elevator arrived and action started. Petri. &gt;&gt; Yeah, of course I should try to

influence the minister somehow, but like I just have a story. I hope that it's kind of gives a positive signal. Uh this is related to education. Some of you may know an online course called elements of

AI. We developed it in in Finland and it translated to all EU countries. It has reached two million users at the moment. So it's it's a nice one example of nice tool where people can themselves whoever

this is not meant for university students this is meant for citizens at large. So why I brought this up is that I like when you can see this as a statistical experiment like who is

willing to learn about AI. This is very simple elementary as the title says elements of AI. So given an opportunity, you can use it on your phone or a laptop or a pad or whatever. Who is willing to

learn AI? And uh uh to my surprise uh in the Nordics, well half of the users are female, which is not perhaps surprising in the Nordics, but even globally we have users all over the world. I think

almost half of the users are female. While I thought like well you know it's mostly the stereotype is that young males engineering type of nerds are those who are most interested in

learning about AI. It it was everybody. It was also senior people. I think like quarter of the users are over 50 or something. So kind of the positive signal is that given an opportunity

people are willing to learn about this new technology and they should learn learn so that they can resist misinformation and all the hype that is around us.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen. Our session has come to the end. We have learned and shared good practices. And once again 2026 is a year where students are using AI. Most of the schools are

not. Lawyers are using AI. Courts are not. Civil servants are using AI. Ministries are not. regular clerks and people in in

businesses are using companies are not. It's a shift which needs to take place. It's not about convincing end user but making all institutions organizations and ecosystems benefit of that

technology. Thank you so much for your wisdom. Thank you so much for the time. It was a pleasure. Uh everybody, sorry for the audience. I have an announcement.
