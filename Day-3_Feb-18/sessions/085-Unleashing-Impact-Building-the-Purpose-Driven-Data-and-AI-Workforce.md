## 📝 Transcript

is about what becomes achievable when we invest not only in technology but in people, communities, ecosystems. Thank you all for being here and for believing as we do at data.org that data

and AI placed in the hands of purpose-driven data and AI practitioners, the people can change lives at scale. Data.org is accelerating the power of data and AI to solve some

of our greatest challenges. We think globally and work locally to accelerate this power to solve some of these challenges. At data.org, we see our role in three ways. We convene. We bring

together governments, civil society, academia, industry, nonprofits. Because no single organization or sector can solve these problems alone. We connect through the capacity accelerator network

of networks that you'll hear a lot about today. There are trainings, fellowships, digital learning, experiential learning programs, community engagement, hackathons, case studies, several tools

that we are developing with partners that then create the workforce that we are going to talk about today. And we catalyze, we accelerate impact. So solutions don't stay local, small, or

siloed, but instead scale to improve millions of lives across the globe. Today, the work spans five global hubs across the United States, Africa, Latin America, India, and the Asia-Pacific.

Each uniquely rooted in its region with specific needs that are very local yet united in a shared mission and learnings to build data and AI workforce across financial inclusion, climate, low

resource languages and health while deepening the intersection of these domains where real transformation happens. We have now trained and engaged over 150,000 people and worked with over

9,000 organizations. Alongside 100 plus partners, we have developed several digital learning offerings, run hackathons, innovation challenges, and secured 10 government

partnerships to scale skilling and impact. Together, we are marching towards our goal of 1 million purpose-driven data and AI practitioners by 2032.

But our work is far more than just about numbers. It is about an African CAN fellow from Ghana gaining economic security for his community by unlocking data sets through connection to partners

in India. an academician at a small university in Hana or Odisha reusing experiential learning approaches from CAN that were in fact developed in another part of the world into their

classroom for benefits to reach tier 2 and tier three universities that would have otherwise not had access to such curriculum. Can learners and fellows reimagining a just transition through

bottomup approaches for low-income urban settlements in Odisha? From our keynote speaker and expert panelists, you'll hear stories of partnership, learning, experimentation, and scale. You'll see

what becomes possible when capacity meets community. And most importantly, you will see what partnerships makes possible. So without further ado, I'll bring on our keynote speaker today.

Thank you all for being here. Thank you for believing and supporting a future where an AI ready workforce can unleash impact at scale to serve humanity. Let me introduce our keynote speaker, a very

special guest, Dr. Oie Stewart, vice president inclusive innovation and analytics at Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth to deliver this keynote on investing in data and AI capacity

building for social impact exploring how philanthropy can strategically build a future ready workforce. Dr. Let's do it. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Priyank.

It's good to be among friends. Uh good morning and everyone. Um, it's an honor to be with all my friends and so many of you who are leaders in the space who are committed to advancing social and

economic impact through data and AI. Today, frontline organizations around the world are tackling increasingly complex crisis from pandemics to displacement to

climate shock. Their courage is extraordinary, but too often they lack the data and AI capabilities that are needed to act with the speed, precision, and scale that the

moment, this moment requires. Think about this. We would never send firefighters into a burning building without equipment. So we cannot send social impact

organizations into addressing societal challenges without the data and AI capabilities that define this modern era, the era of AI. And this is where all of us in the room,

funders, educators, practitioners, public and private leaders, we all have a responsibility to act because the future of inclusive growth depends on building a purpose-driven

data and AI workforce that is equipped, empowered, and anchored on impact. At the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, we believe that philanthropy must invest in enabling infrastructure

that includes people, platforms, and partnerships. These will let organizations unlock the power of data for good. That is why five years ago, along with the Rockefeller Foundation,

we helped create data.org. As you all know, a platform for partnerships to democratize data science and embed it in the operations of organizations that are serving millions around the world

through the capacity acceleration network now spanning over 100 partners. We've seen what strategic investment can do. Let me read it off. You heard from Priyank. Five accelerators across four

continents, 150 people train, 50,000 people trained and more, nine digital learning courses, 10 government partnerships that are fueling scale for impact around the

world. These numbers matter, but I tell you, it's the stories behind them that matter even more. Yesterday, we had the privilege of hearing some amazing stories that's

happening within the CAN network. Permit me to just share a few of mine because I'm a data scientist. During the COVID period in Togo, which is a country in West Africa, data.org

partnered with Give Directly to support the government in using machine learning to target emergency cash assistance, reaching the country's lowest income residents faster and more accurately

than ever. I think the number is about 137,000 people were reached. Think about impact in India. A simple analytic model helped farmers reduce food waste by predicting shelf life. That work became

critical when global green shortages hit. Across these very two simple examples, one truth is clear. Investing in data and AI capacity saves time, saves

resources, and in my two examples, actually save lives. Think about that. But smart capacity building requires more than funding training programs. As a funer, and to funders in the room, we

must ask where is the greatest leverage? Where is the sector ready to absorb talent? And how can we ensure investments that lead to impact not frustration?

If you look all around you around the world right now, the need is massive. The social sector alone will require 3.5 million additional data scientists in the next decade. In this decade of AI,

data.org or with the support from Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth is committed to help train 1 million purpose-driven data practitioners with two things in mind, diversity and

localism. But funders cannot only focus on the supply side because hear me now talent without opportunity becomes a waste and opportunity without talent becomes

stagnation. Training practitioners is only half the equation. If organizations lack systems, culture, governance, and leadership commitment, these newly trained data

scientists will have nowhere to apply their skills. This is where funders are uniquely positioned to act bridging the gap between supply and demand by supporting and I'm just listing a few

here organizational data maturity leadership readiness responsible data governance and [clears throat] the forgotten equation in all of these infrastructure.

We must build not just the workers but the workplace that enables impact. The question we must constantly ask is how do we ensure that capacity building leads to real world impact? Well, the

capacity acceleration network gives us early and clear evidence. Again, I'm just going to list a few. Social enterprises using new data skills to improve climate adaptation. Wink wink

priyank. Health organizations deploying analytics to expand care. cities strengthening financial inclusion through stronger data systems. These aren't isolated outcomes. They are

proof points that strategic investments work and they show us that when both sides of the equation, namely talent supply and organizational demand are supported, we unlock lasting scalable

systemic changes. So here's the opportunity before us. We can build a world where every organization fights poverty, protects public health, strengthens communities

or builds climate resilience that and they would have access to the same kind of data that we see in the private sector which are well funded now being available in the social sector.

We can build a a workforce of 1 million that are not just skilled but empowered to drive impact on the issues that matter most. Again, wink wink localism. Let me bring this keynote to a close.

And I'd like to close with a famous African proverb that's often attributed to Chinoa Achbe and it says until the lion learns to write every story will glorify the hunter. Let me

repeat that. Until the lion learns to write, every story will glorify the hunter. What this proverb emphasizes is that history is written by the victors or dominant groups. It highlights that

without a voice, the perspective of the marginalized, the defeated or silenced will always be omitted, making stories one-sided. What kind of world is that? So we can build an inclusive ecosystem

that ensures that practitioners thrive, contribute and transform our collective capacity for good. But only if we choose as funders, as educators, as innovators to invest boldly, intentionally, and

together. The future of inclusive economic growth will not be shaped by algorithms alone. Who wants that? but by the people who designed them, question them, and use

them to build a more inclusive, resilient, and prosperous world. Let's unleash that impact. Let's build that workforce, but more importantly, let's build it together.

Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Dr. Stewart. Uh we'll now move on to the main panel discussion uh here and I'll invite my colleague uh Perry Huitt, our chief strategy officer

to take us forward. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Ooey remains the toughest act to follow in this entire conference. So thank you so much for your forbearance. He's really remarkable. I will in the

spirit of collaboration quibble with one of the things he said which is that we're sending firefighters into a burn burning building um you know ill equipped. What I worry is we've given

the firefighters all the equipment and none of the training with the tools that are available to us today to do solutions that are good and bad. It's really scary to think what is possible

unless we center these efforts around people first, you know, thinking in terms of data and AI. And that's why we're working to build one million purpose-driven data practitioners. But

without further ado, let me get on to the panel. Um I have a series of questions and I'd love for you to interrupt each other and introduce a little of that Delhi traffic chaos into

this conversation. So Tav, I'll start with you. Universities are clearly the pipeline for purpose-driven data and AI workforce. How did tripleIT Delhi design

training for the capacity accelerator network to produce practitioners who are not just technically skilled and we talk about the risks of people who are just technically skilled but ready to drive

real world impact in the social sector. What kind of training do you have to give them to get these sort of well-rounded purpose-driven data practitioners? Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Perry and thank you data.org and can partners for this fantastic conversation. Um we are a technical university very much grounded in computer science as a core discipline

but also with interdisciplinary departments. So I work in the department of computational biology we have a center for social sciences and humanity department of computation social

sciences and humanities. So I think when we were designing this program we were very much aware and while as a technical university when you go to your senates and the boards they're very much

technical focused right. So what is how does it compare with uh the other technical education programs across the country and the world and we are only about 17 years old now and within a very

short span of time within the first 10 in the computer science across the country. uh but then we were very very much uh also um emphasizing the need for bringing technical education together

with the users point of view at the end of the day and I come from healthcare I work in AI for healthcare so that was my lens of looking at things and my colleagues lenses were coming from

social sciences humanities climate agriculture so we had all these very nice set of colleagues from various departments who came together and actually provided inputs

um and also taught the uh taught the course. But I think what I would like to emphasize is that is not enough. What we still do think is that the heart of this was collaborations. This was not about

triple IT alone. Um as coming from healthcare, we've been working with um hospitals, public health agencies for more than 15 years now and they remained a key partner in all of this um design

of the program and and also the conversations that went into it. Similarly going forward as we look into it at look look into how do we actually create impact with the with the data

scientists we have to create impact in the peace time we cannot rely upon a pandemic to force us into delivering solutions which will be AI solutions right India is a fantastic example we

were way ahead in digital uh and technology and we delivered the vaccine uh frameworks and the vaccination platform platforms coind was a fantastic example but not AI right we still have a

long way to go with AI so I think this is a time which we have to co-develop all these programs along with our partners and that's one of the key things which we kept in mind while we

were designing the the program so our program had a lot of case studies which covered some of these aspects our faculty colleagues members including myself basically are rooted very

strongly in not just uh teaching but also teaching what we do in our research and what we deploy in our research. So I think that was one of the key things we did um keep at the center of our uh

design of the program as well. But how do we bring these sort of lived experiences in building this out for a hospital or for for a farmer and then bring it to the conversation in the

class and and then perhaps not just um uh have a conversation but also empower with tools that are then the real world deployment through these. So that was very much central to it and and of

course then it comes to having all the regulations etc which are not easy to work with because if you're looking at such a program you're looking at a degree or a diploma which is catering to

a wide audience it is catering to social sciences healthcare technical how do you really design the program that will equally cater to all of these yet satisfy the credits requirement that a

university has to fulfill so but I think um that took us some time but we were able to I'm thankful for the opportunity by data data.org. I think it has given us a platform to really demonstrate that

it can be done. We have now trained more than 250 learn actually the third cohort is again so about 300 learners currently being trained 250 graduated. So essentially which gives us a lot of

confidence that this needs to be done this can be done. we can be rigorous with our training grounded in math and the stats and the machine learning and AI yet have all the um uh all the all

the connect with the ground uh to make it possible. I'll I'll not take more time. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I love your point about collaboration and it shouldn't take a

crisis for us to figure out how to collaborate on this stuff. So moving on to Niha Janagra became a capacity accelerator network for host organization taking on a CAN data

fellow. The fellows obviously gained rich experience in applying their new skills to real work challenges, but what's the organizational impact of bringing in a can fellow? How did you

feel that within Janagra? And I know I've heard from TT you're a significant mentor to a lot of these young folks. So, how did that affect your role there? Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Perry. And thank you so much for having me on this panel. So today I'd like to um highlight three things that really stood out for me from this wonderful uh partnership with uh can

fellowship. Uh the first thing I would like to say is that for us it was a lot more than you know just adding capacity to the team or to the organization. It was really bringing together

complimentary skills. At uh Janagra we have deep domain expertise around urban governance citizen participation and when this comes together with the fellows data and AI skills it really

leads to exponential impact on ground. So I think the complimentarity of uh bringing in a can fellow into an organization like Janagraha is really supremely valuable.

uh just as an example. So Pesh is sitting right here and she played a fundamental role in designing the data backbone of uh the city data and analytics platform that Janagraha is

building as a micro site to Niti Aayog's national data and analytics platform and uh really the depth of her technical work played a key role in uh you know mining the data sets understanding them

and giving seed up the shape that it holds today and also uh defining some of the dreams that we have uh on seed. The second thing that I'd like to say is I think that the can fellows come with

beautiful intersectional expertise of data AI and tech and that leads to you know really powerful bridges that they have built within the organization between the program teams like where I

work in the research and MEL team and let's say the tech team in the organization or even if you go out and hire a tech organization to just simply build the platform because often times I

feel like people on the program side and the tech side don't speak the same language. So I feel like the can fellows play that powerful role of communication and translating each other's visions,

dreams, uh you know knowledge. So that's the second thing I'd like to say. And the last thing is that I also feel like there is a really big ripple effect in the organization. So after Pravesh and

Nikila worked with us and you know they demonstrated the power of unlocking data sets AI I see a lot of movement within our team and also across the organization where data AI they're all

coming to the surface and everyone's talking about it and everyone's reaching out to them and then also starting to learn and look out for you know events conversations so I see a really big uh

ripple effect in that sense. &gt;&gt; That's great. I love the idea of can fellows as bridgebuilders. Can you talk a little bit more about your mentorship role in those situations?

[laughter] So, um again, I think um it's it's two-way mentorship in the sense of uh like it's two-way, right? So, they bring such brilliance and dedication to the team

that is very easy to mentor them. Uh I think u I think it's it's really valuable to build a really strong cohesive team and uh I think that's been the foundation of our mentorship that

we're all in this together and together we bring out the best uh you know for all of us. I feel there's some reverse mentoring that goes on sometimes with these can fellas as well. Uh so TT JPAL

sits at the intersection of research and action through the capacity accelerator network. JPAL placed trainees into social impact organizations as fellows. How do you ensure how do you make sure

that those fellows you place aren't just learning skills but translating them into critical data and evidence that can potentially help make policy decisions? &gt;&gt; Thanks so much for that question, Perry,

and thank you to the friends at data.org um for inviting me here. Um I was just reflecting with a lot of the panelists here that it's been three years now that we've been building this. Um and it's

been a labor of love but more importantly it's been just the collaboration right. Um so to that particular question just to take a step back and help the audience understand

what JALL does. er over the past two decades we have been working on trying to see how scientific evidence can inform policym um decision- making um at times these

are very critical decisions that will be affecting the lives of millions of people and throughout our journey we've realized that insights data evidence is something that needs to be built but to

do that Um what we need in a country like India which has complex demographic, complex problems, complex I would say challenges, infrastructure, so on and so forth is the right kind of

capacity to be built and then that capacity going on and creating a multiplier effect for building organizational capability and governance capabilities. So I really liked the

point that UI made and he always makes very lovely points but it's about identifying the key leverage areas. Um for us um throughout this journey with CAN um it has been exactly that. uh

we've had fantastic partners on one side with the universities where they have a unique leverage point of identifying the right kind of talent, supporting the right kind of talent and also sort of

collaborating and building with us in terms of that bridge from data technology to social impact. What does that look like? Um we have this unique I would say leverage point wherein we are

well connected with the demand ecosystem. We have n number of partners in India. But because we have n number of partners in India, it also becomes a little bit of an identification problem,

right? In the sense who needs data capacity most, who needs unlocking data sets most, who needs what. So you need to understand the enabling conditions that would actually unleash the right

kind of potential when you place the right kind of person in that particular organization. So for us it's been a mix of all of those parameters going in. I'm going to take a I'm not going to uh just

not to sound partial I'm not going to use the Janalraha case but the Janagraha partnership for us has been such a beautiful learning experience. It helps us, it helped us define not just what we

are looking for in terms of organizations to partner with to place these highly talented young professionals with hopes and dreams of changing the world in but also the

importance of mentorship, the importance of the organization enabling, owning, having accountability towards the experience that the fellows will have. Um and when we have that right kind of

mix we see you know wonderful work that Janha is doing but I'm going to give an example of the policy side of things where currently we have a fellow of ours um who's working with uh the Jaljivan

mission on um trying to understand how water infrastructure changes and policies related to water infrastructure can have impact on disease burden. Now, as you can imagine,

it is a very complex problem statement. It's not going to come out of one data set, one dashboard or one insight, but it's going to require an ecosystem of experts coming together to be able to

help the fellow unpack that to be able to create some meaningful insight for the decision makers and policy makers. So, we are our fingers are crossed that something exciting is going to come out

of that. But that's been one of the very exciting things that we've been working on. Thanks for sharing that. You mentioned the multiplier effect. Um, and Tav, you mentioned 300 in the most

recent cohort of how how do you the two of you, it would be really interesting to hear how do you both think about that? How do you think about of those 300 people? Are they going back into 100

200 person social impact organizations and what what do you see is the the ripple effect of the important work you're doing? I think um the way we look at it is not

all will go back into social impact but u me jal has been a fantastic and art park have been fantastic um uh collaborators partners in this um uh endeavor. Basically I think we are

looking for that um the the tipping point where we actually start seeing social impact through the through the um um through the fellows we train. Most of the cohort members that we've had are

already working professionals with jobs that they already have. They are coming to get more exposure to AI and and looking for impact in healthcare or social uh social sector or perhaps

climate and agriculture. Uh but many of them actually go back to their own jobs. I think the ripple effect is when they go back to their own jobs then what do they do there is a little bit harder

challenge to solve for and to track but I think that's something which which is the multiplier that that would come with time yeah &gt;&gt; thank you TG and for us it's on the

opposite end how I think about multiplier effect firstly I think going back to uh Tav's point about incentivizing this is one thing that we always knew was going to be a challenge

we were going to invite young professionals in you know support their career switch but also to see whether that career switch is going to be sustainable right but in the short run

not to confuse that with myopia is to make sure that the data capabilities of certain organizations are being built but when they go back to their own organizations are they making slightly

different choices but for jal it's slightly on the other side wherein for us the fellows are sort of an instrument to creating that mult multiplier effect. For example, if we have a Praves who's a

data fellow who's going to be working with Janagraha, she's one individual working with one organization which has a strong network and helping that organization create a multiplier effect

whether it's solutions and climate and health whether it's unlocking data an influence that can affect millions of lives. So for me that is the multiplier effect journey.

&gt;&gt; Thanks so much helpful. So bio over to you. I loved always anecdote of the lion and the hunter and how do we tell the stories of lions and one of the ways we tell those stories is understanding the

lion's language. So as we heard in his keynote the oh sorry uh you've been a longtime champion for locally grounded data and AI training. Recently data.org data science Nigeria University of Lagos

and University of Ptoria came together to develop an Africa lowresource languages playbook. How did that playbook collaboration underscore why localism another favorite word in

capacity building is critical and what's lost when we ignore it? So help us understand how are you getting to the lion's language here? &gt;&gt; Uh thank you very much. Um I I think

first I'll be talking on behalf of the three organizations supported by data.org or to put together the body of work on how to uh collect data from low-income communities, empower people

to collect their data so that AI can learn their language and AI can work for them. Now the fundamental purpose is that if language is the fundamental expression of the culture of a people,

if it is not digitized in the emerging digital era, it means that a whole essence of a people can be lost. then it becomes a sense you know an an existential reality to ensure that every

language that defines every culture is properly digitized so that AI can learn and it can work for everyone and no one is left behind that's the fundamental purpose of that initiative and what are

the principles underscoring that if AI speaks like us we will trust it and if we trust AI I will use it more. So if AI is not grounded in the reality, in the nuance, in the context of the people,

you know, people will not use it. And I'm not just talking about generic uh, you know, conversation. I'm talking about context. I'm talking about ethical boundaries. I'm talking about cultural

groundedness. AI must be able to recognize those, you know, those boundaries. And the only way that can happen is to empower the owners of the language to be part of how those data

are collected. Now a lot has happened in the last one two three years. We've seen a lot of startups that emerge uh that join uh the entrepreneurial side of scrape data online and build the eye

model. But we've seen that those models are not representative. They are biased. They do not reflect the realities of the people because most of global s languages are spoken they are not

digitized. So there must be an effort to digitize them. So the next question is how do we digitize those languages? Of course there are many ways to do it. But the biggest way to do it is to empower

the people with the right knowledge framework and best practice to be able to do it themselves at their own pace and for their own good. So that when they co-own the process then they can co

own the outcome as well and that is what data.org gets done. So it's beyond inclusion by data collection is inclusion in how the data is collected by ensuring that that knowledge is

democratized is accessible and available to everyone. So essentially the playbook cataloges the methodology the best practice of how data can be collected. It learns from what has worked and what

has not worked. It puts together all the fundamental principles from various ecosystem players to help anyone any group of people that would like to digitize their language in a very

inclusive and representative manner so that they can go through the process and use the book. And that is why it's called a playbook, you know, and it serves as a platform for anyone uh that

want to go on that journey. and and the way it is structured is the fact that it goes beyond generic data collection. It recognizes that in global south there are things like code mixing. There are

things like code switching. There are things like ascent. There are a lot of things like dialect variations. There are a lot of things that are semantical expressions that are not currently

digitized. So it provides those universe of possibilities. So it's like your you know your one-stop reference point that catalogs everything you need to do from building ontology for example to

linguistic standardizations to annotation mechanisms labeling approach modeling best practices and that is why the work was not just done by an academic environment it was an inclusive

one. Right? Language it is is not something that is owned by a you know a a a select set of people. Language is universal. So the process of collecting language must also

have a sense of universality where people irrespective of their knowledge level, their age, their gender are involved and that was what we learned that there must be a bottom up approach

of people on the street because they also have their own language as well. So we must be able to take those language and of course those who are in the academia who understand uh linguistic

standardization lexical framework are also included. So it is that bottom up and top down approach that inform uh the work that was done to put together the body of work to help anyone to collect.

But what is more important is turning it into a platform to platformize it. And what does that mean? It becomes a reference point where you go, you learn and after you have done your own work,

you can come back there and share your own experience as well. Maybe while you are collecting your own data, you learn some new ways of doing it. You saw some things that never worked. Then you can

bring those learning back to that framework. So it becomes a living case study or a living reference point. And the last layer of the work is the fact that is intended to build shared

pipeline. Pipeline of talent, pipeline of expertise and pipeline of experiences so that as much as possible we can begin to have people taking the responsibility in their community to begin to collect

data. And one of our fellows uh a young man called Gideon actually proved that it's very possible for one single individual to take on the responsibility of mobilizing a community to collect his

own data. This gentleman from northern Nigeria started the project of saying I want to digitize the language of my community and he went through a process similar to what is defined in the

playbook. He you know he worked with the community champions, the community elites, the community expert and everyday people and they started putting together the catalog of their language

and over a period of 6 months this gentleman was able to have the language of his people digitized properly annotated so that AI can learn and this for me becomes a big responsibility that

we have in global south. Nobody's going to do this for us. We're not going to wait for Silicon Valley to digitize a language that to them does not have commercial value. But for us, it's not

about commerce. It's about our identity. Is about our existence. So the onus is therefore on us to use the playbook as a reference point to initiate the process of governizing our community to collect

our data so that AI can learn us, understand us, and most importantly serve us in every way possible. Thank you. &gt;&gt; That was terrific. Thank you so much.

Uh, one follow- on question to that. First of all, it's great to hear about champions and communities as key because I would argue that Silicon Valley could not even with all the money in the world

do as good a job as someone who's rooted in the community. Um, but my question is, you brought together three institutions, two countries to put together this playbook. What surprised

you or what did you learn? I know DSN is an expert in this field, so not a lot would surprise you, but was there anything someone else brought to the table you thought, "Oh, wow. We really

want to learn from that." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I I think what's what I learned I've actually mentioned is the fact that language collection or language is universal.

&gt;&gt; It does it has nothing to do with your educational level. The the person we call illiterate for as much as a person can speak the person might be a better custodian of the language than a PhD in

linguistic in that language &gt;&gt; and that is one fact that we learn. So therefore the process must be inclusive intentionally and that was what we learned as data science Nigeria when you

know in certain terminology certain methodology by the time you went to the street and we validated it with the language owners we realize that some of the things that the academia has said

are not real to the language owners. Those things have evolved over time. Things that are called idioctics, you know, idiocts which are like idioms or slangs, you know, neologism, they evolve

with time. But academic learn those things maybe 10 years ago or 20 years ago. And you know the way research works when data is not representative, incremental research builds on the use

of efficient data. But you have to go to the street. So when we went to the street, when we spoke to the real people, we got the real answer. And that is why the whole idea of language data

collection as represented by the uh playbook done by data.org has a simple principle. It must be bottom up and it must be top down. Everyone must be included. Even date, we want data to be

collected for impact and to serve people that is meant for. &gt;&gt; Terrific. Thanks so much. So one of the things looking across this panel we have academic institutions, social impact

organizations, people who sit at the intersection of research and policy um and we have folks representing the private sector. So kicking off you know we heard a little bit about Mastercard's

theory of why investing in social impact mattered. Can we hear a little bit more about cognizance? &gt;&gt; Uh thanks Perry. Okay on the dark side of things. Um hi I'm Praiba. I lead

social impact for cognizant across uh APJ and when it comes to AI skilling and purpose uh we also start with research. So one of our very popular research out there is called new work new world and

we uh we had one version couple of years back and we uh just released uh the latest version and what new work new world basically says is that AI of course and I mean everyone knows this AI

is fundamentally shaping work as we know it. It's reimagining workflows. So AI is pretty much here to stay. Jobs are being redefined, right? So what does that mean? Which means that we need to take a

responsibility for AI skills. There is AI skills and there is also humanentric skills. Human skills like uh judgment and reasoning, ethical reasoning, uh also critical thinking, collaboration,

all of that. And the third part is uh for us to really again from an impact standpoint for us to really bring scale to this it means that uh we need to take responsibility for our ecosystems. Now

grounded in this rooted in this is our global uh initiative called Synapse and we also share the 1 million number. So we started in 2023 our goal was to upskill 1 million folks in our ecosystem

to ensure that they're able to thrive in the economy. And I'm so happy to say we actually uh you know we met our goal a year ahead of time and then we doubled the goal for ourselves. So now we're

chasing 2 million. But again like somebody here said it's really not about the numbers. It's really about the intent and really about uh understanding what matters. Now how do we uh activate

synapse? So activation of synapse again grounded in research. uh there are different levers but for the purpose of this audience and uh you know uh the work that I do uh in social impact we

have two levers so one is philanthropic grants again just like Mastercard uh we fund we fund purpose-led organizations that are able to support our communities uh to really thrive in the AI economy

with skills with opportunities internships hackathons you know the whole uh hog of things now the second lever that we activate is by uh through volunteerism. So I I know you might be a

little skeptical can really volunteers drive impact but that's something that we are actually seeing and I'll tell you some interesting things about it. So we train our own employees and they run AI

workshops. So these are not like the fully funded grants but basically think of it as three to four hour workshops where the focus is on uh AI fluency but also importantly getting hands-on and

working on use cases that can bring people together and really unlock human skills right and what we observed is innovation thrives people come alive when you throw a challenge at them that

that improves lives for pe I like someone said not improves lives scratch that saves lives when you're talking when you're bringing in problems which really impacts people and saves lives uh

the energy in the room just changes I think that is really fundamental to why purpose is so important now I said these are two levers what we accidentally unlocked was a third lever and that

third lever is our own people our employees of course we have formal skilling programs for them but when they were trained to run these programs for our communities and they were mentoring

uh you know mentoring the groups their own skills I mean the skills uplift uh for our employees that showed a dramatic spike uh their again their leadership skills their ability to collaborate and

very very interestingly their ability to design an solution for our clients so you know using the same reflexes back at work uh that I think um again accidentally uh unlocked something

really amazing so I think The bottom line for us here is that when we intentionally uh embed purpose uh into everything that we do uh especially on the especially when it comes to AI

skilling what we are seeing is we are able to create positive outcomes of course for our communities also for our clients this is private sector also for our clients and very importantly for our

own people when I say people our employees. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I love that point about improved employee engagement, but also employed improved employee skills, right?

Absolutely. &gt;&gt; They're taking these skills and applying them to real world problems and there's something to be gained for the private sector there as well.

&gt;&gt; So, finally, I'm going to introduce a quick lightning round of what gives you hope. If everyone could if we can go down the it's been a few tumultuous years in various places around the globe

and one of the things we really look for is building this workforce of purpose-driven data practitioners. we see the opportunity to create a better world. So I'd love to hear just starting

with Tav like what in what sentence or you know roughly a sentence what you hope &gt;&gt; just came out of PMAC earlier this month uh and it was all about the global

shifts that were happening so pessimistic but when I look at India AI summit I think the youth energy that you see around AI and the numbers just just sheer numbers and the excitement around

it uh that is one of the indicators that that we are there's energy people want to build do things and and it's going to &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd just like to say I feel like AI, big data tech is like the new

equipment in the market and I feel like there is a lot of hope to use it really well to change lives of people on the ground especially like the urban poor especially people who live in cities you

know engines of growth for our country today. So I've been thinking about this. Um I think to sum it up in one word, it would be the convergence. Um we see

people from technology, academia, uh private sector, public sector, social impact all coming together to solve for the future. And I think conversations and collaborations are we don't have to

wait for COVID or pandemics to come in. already know that collaboration is going to be key. So I think that convergence on that particular point has been very hopeful. Thanks.

&gt;&gt; For me, I I'll summarize it as inclusion and I'll use a popular saying for my own part of the word that says that if you want to bab you cannot bab a man's head in his absence. He must be there and

present. Same. You cannot give a woman the most gorgeous hairstyle by sending it via the best logistics. She must be there and be the center of attraction. So if you want to build for people, then

they must be the center and everyone must be included if you really want to be for people. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm going to speak for the private

sector. I think we are going to steal purpose from the social sector with AI. Uh that's because I mean with AI automating a lot of work as we know it um of course human skills are going to

come into play but what's going to be a real differentiator for private sector organizations is having a workforce that's purpose-led because then you're innovating you know something that AI

can't do you're uh really problem solving for real challenges real impact and uh that's why we're going to steal it from you guys [laughter] &gt;&gt; well what gives me a tremendous amount

of hope is a panel like this where you're bringing together so many different skill sets and perspectives and learning some real practical ways how we can all contribute to the world

with data and AI for social impact. When PON kicked us off today, he reminded us that today is about more than just data or AI. It's about possibility. And at data.org, we're very focused on what may

be possible with our 1 million purpose-driven data practitioners. What's possible in my view gets more astonishing every single day, especially when you center your work around people.

But the huge advances in technology, but more importantly the innovative ways people are applying them, I find just to be both hopeful and inspiring and real potential. Thank you all for joining us

here this afternoon. We're closing this event, but let's please consider this to be the beginning of a dialogue. Come say hello, connect with some of our remarkable partners here and of course

stay in touch with us and download that languages playbook at data.org. Thanks so much. Thank you so much. [applause] &gt;&gt; Exit.

Thank you for taking the traffic.
