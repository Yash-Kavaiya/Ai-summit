## 📝 Transcript

of their thinking. And what that has really meant is are we still teaching people to think. Um I I like to say that real learning really happens uh means that thinking and problem solving until

your brain hurts. Yeah. You really feel your brain hurt. Um and that productive struggle is where learning sits. Um and that is becoming increasingly difficult um to cultivate when we answer when

every answer is just a single prompt away. Um so then the next challenge is the pace of technology itself. Um the last two years have frankly um as an educator been perplexing because

innovation's moving fast and as education educators we're asking ourselves some hard questions. What value do we bring? How do we need to change what we teach and how we test it?

And the tools that we use to test critical thinking are really falling short. Um, if those of us who are training the future workforce at wellresourced institutions like John's

Hopkins are struggling to keep up, I imagine what it looks like for a healthcare worker in an underserved district who has never actually received any structural digital education.

Um and so the gap between the pace of innovation and the readiness of our workforce is where the span what this panel is aiming to address today. Um our panelists will examine six

interconnected dimensions of this challenge. Organizational actors who must be at the table. We know the ministry of health is an actor but there are education universities there are

professional associations. There are software vendors. There are technology associations, engineering universities, um and so on. Um there's also diverse types of personnel u that need to be

reached. Um healthcare professionals but also technologists, informaticians and so on. um engineers um the modalities through which we can deliver training because we need to think about

pre-ervice training when we think about the long-term future and then we need to think about the now which is inservice training to rapidly get our workforce ready. Um there are significant equity

considerations which often get overlooked especially when we think about technology. Gender gets overlooked quite quite seriously and then there are some other barriers, cultural barriers,

structural barriers, resource barriers. Um so what we are here to ask today is what does it really take to build a workforce that is ready? Uh not just the tools that are available today but

imagining the pace for what is coming in the future in the next 5 10 years. what do we need to build now to be ready for that? Um and so with that I am delighted to have this wonderful panel. I'll hold

off on introducing the panel till we can have Dr. Sachin Sharma offer opening remarks. He's the director general of uh of duction. So please Dr. Sharma welcome.

[applause] Uh first of all thank you very much uh for inviting me and uh okay two or three points uh see I'm not expert in the health I'm a trade person

but uh why the duin or the ra we are involved in in it uh duin way the ra duin is a center within ra and it is a voice of global south and uh it was opened in 2023 and there

uh We are working on agriculture, digital and health. And health is a very important issue. And we are not working only in India. We are have a very good network of uh think tanks. Uh if I say

it around 157 think tank across 90 countries. So that is the vast network we are working on this. Now when we are talking about the AI and the health uh uh challenges in most of the developing

country in the global south we you will see the lot of variations especially about the challenges the different countries are facing in health sector. So you will face uh uh that uh in the

some countries even the basic digital divide is there that we are talking about AI that the digital divide one is the point where I'm talking about then the second factor is that whether the

basic health services also available or not here the primary health workers role is extremely important and there we need uh even the yesterday uh our PM also said that what we required skilling and

rescale feeling and this applicable not only for other sphere but also the health workers as well who are in the frontier. So in uh in this case uh because I also

wanted to learn I will not take much time because uh already bit delay but uh I would also looking forward for very insightful discussion. Thank you very much. [applause]

&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you. Thank you Dr. Sharma. Um and so let's maybe get started with our panel. We have uh an excellent panel here today. Um this I'm not going in the order of where the panelists are seated

but uh Dr. Anurag Agarval. He um uh he is the dean biosciences and health research um at Ashoka University. Um we have Dr. Mona Dugal who's the director of ICMR National Institute for Research

in Digital Health and Data Sciences. uh like my center the center has a long name uh Dr. Mona Cocher uh who's advisor health advisor to Dakshin RAIS Dr. Ranja Kumar uh Kumar who's the chief executive

officer for Chakra Nasi MUHS uh Dr. Title, director of regional center for human rights uh in Thailand and professor Fouad whose education and cultural atache embassy of republic of

Indonesia. Um so with that maybe I will start with um Dr. Anerag Agaral. Um my question to you is um that the quota center for digital health it works on

interdisciplinary collaborations and of course in AI that is absolutely critical um as you consider data science but you also think about biomedical sciences and its application to help. What from your

perspective are some of the skills that uh that educational institutes need to develop? &gt;&gt; Thank you very much Sisha and as you indicated earlier AI has really changed

the game quite a bit. classical skills that were more about information retention and production will increasingly become less relevant and ability to use AI will become

increasingly more relevant. At the same time from an educational institution point of you can't dilute critical thinking and knowledge especially in mission critical applications like

health where if AI were to fail would you still be able to do the task. So very broadly dividing as a general policy in training of students at large one must ensure they can do critical

tasks without any digital health available to them but they empowered to use it in such a way to be the most productive version there are and this involves complete rethinking of the

education evaluation system. You must go down to very basic systems from time to time when you cut off all digital access while evaluating them &gt;&gt; but also you must almost encourage so we

do that at Ashoka. So Gemini for example as part of a workspace is encouraged to be used including in homework but the questions to be set are thought of in such a way that you are allowed to push

yourself to the boundary. Now coming to the larger problem of health and I'll be brief on this. Health of the future will not look like health of today with increasing emphasis on health promotion,

maintenance, wellness, things like this. People far beyond the medical space will become engaged in the process of health sciences. In fact, I would argue the health will

move out of medical schools and public health at one part was never classically medical to begin with and we'll see a generation of people engaged in quantitative thinking, data science who

will be contributing to the health ecosystem and we're not ready for that in India. At least our medical colleges, our engineering colleges, our universities are all completely

dissociated and we will need to think of ecosystems where all this comes together rather than medical colleges opening departments of health informatics. That

will not be sufficient. It'll be about rethinking what you do in the age of AI. And I would actually argue that as time goes forward, understanding of problems, an engineering mindset, but not an

engineer, an engineering mindset that breaks down the problem into solvable parts and uses AI to think about it will become increasingly important. I don't think we are getting there yet. We want

to produce more AI engineers. What we need to produce are more domain knowledge people with wide grounding who think like engineers in breaking down a problem. I think that's what we need to

do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's a I I think that's a tall task, right? Because the incentives to think are actually much slimmer now. And um um yeah, some excellent excellent

points. Um uh Dr. Mon, maybe I'll move on to you. And um of course as a you're a medical doctor um what are skills that you think are critical um for medical and paramedical professionals that the

education system the medical education system doesn't yet address but is really critical for the future workforce. &gt;&gt; Um thanks Anisha I will take it where Anurak left. uh two things when we are

talking about medical and I think increasingly it has been getting highlighted uh the medical professionals really need to upskill themselves at this point and uh given when you simply

just look at the level when we are at the top and the people who are running the any medtech industry there's a huge generation gap uh we generally like go slowly and the people who sit at the top

it comes with experience it's not that the youngster is going to be put on the top immediately. It requires experience. So people who are at the top are generally more experienced less

technology savvy as compared to the new generation that is going on. But given uh the new ecosystem I think with AI and everything nobody everybody has to now upskill themselves but probably it has

to now start from the medical schools and the light schools. So you'll have to rethink how you want to structure your medical curriculum. Earlier it became almost uh done deal that now you have to

get statistics people need to learn statistics at least that became a part of the curriculum. Um what we have realized is when even you are doing uh the MD or the MS courses uh if that can

become a part of it how do you think about research what are the essentials of research how you can use AI and research how the digital tools can be applied in research how you share the

data simple things as that what are the EHRs and everything that should be a part of the curriculum that has to be there at least when you're doing your MD thesis that is a minimum that you can do

for anything we have lot of uh people that do come like coming from PG. I know that we have a lot of people who come from the state systems also. Maybe again redesign people who are coming from the

state systems. They also need to have like even if they do not want to do thesis probably they can do some projects pilot projects with states and if they can actually turn that state

project into learning some of the digital tools just having how the EHRs are going to be there what are the system changes that they can do using AI or any of the digital tools. These are

some of the changes that can be done at the national level where I am like from the national level being a research institute we need to upskill our program managers because even the program

managers who are reviewing the grants I I think I was because I'm on those NSF emails they continuously do this surveys how they can upskill their program managers so that really needs to be done

because people who are reviewing also need to update their skills for review so that they can understand what people are submitting because with increasing cross collaboration we have brilliant

collaborations that are now being put but the unfortunate part is when you actually talk to them they said we do not understand why a grant was rejected and the kind of comments you get back

that needs to be upskilled. So this these things I think both at the level of the input and the output both needs to be balanced &gt;&gt; and I think your last point is uh is

really pertinent uh as well. I um serve as the chief editor of Oxford open digital health journal and um in the last six months we've seen this massive increase in AI based methodology but it

is impossible to find reviewers who can skillfully actually review those papers and provide sound uh peer review which I think is also quite dangerous when we think about the nature of knowledge

right because a lot of the AI models are being built on this published material, but as an editor, it's pretty hard to feel confident in in what you're publishing. And so, um, so I think your

point about like making sure that people who are reviewers who are pay playing that role of of peers and providing guidance on research also have critical skills of at least being informed

consumers um for learning. I feel like you have a point you want to add here. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Great. Okay. So, Professor Fuad um I'll come to you. You work at the

intersection of education, culture and governance. Um and what governance approach is needed to coordinate across ministries and countries for digital health and AI

and &gt;&gt; all right uh thank you very much uh Misha. Uh uh first of all uh thank you very much for inviting me. As Misha just mentioned earlier, my name is Fouad. I

work at the embassy but before that I work at the professor in the ministry minister of higher education in Indonesia but then the minister asked me you know uh to work on the bilateral

cooperation between Indonesia and India on terms of the education science and technology and I am very fortunate to be able to you know uh to be here and uh before I come up with this uh issue I

just would like you to give a brief context of Indonesia particularly For those who are not very familiar with Indonesia, Indonesia is located in Southeast Asia. It is the fourth most

populous countries in the world and uh it comprises of more than 17,000 islands and it has one of the largest health insurance systems in the world. uh it is a bit different with the India

but on terms of how the insurance system is governed uh nationally and on terms of the population covered. Yes, it is the largest and uh answering on terms of the coordination and what are the

obstacles and the opportunities and what we are currently doing is that uh we have one national direction particularly on terms of the health related issues because when we talk about the health

outcomes it means that the outcomes of the health is heavily influenced by the decisions made by other ministries. For instance, uh the uh the minister of health focuses on how

the uh you know uh clinical procedures and the patient safety are the main concern of the minister of health. But for the ministry of higher education, science and technology uh focuses on how

the capacity building on how the doctors, the nurses can be well equipped and can be well you know uh thought on terms of the uh health and also the technological

uh uh issues needed for for the for those uh doctors and nurses and similarly with other ministries as well the minister of finance the minister of let's say the digital and communication

are also the important parts of when we talk about how the coordination between the health related issues. Uh and so yes uh we have to have one clear central direction on uh you know uh

determined by the uh you know by by by the uh central government. Yes. And secondly uh we have to realize that AI is actually is just a platform on which we have to make sure that the people and

uh trust is actually the integral part or the most important part of the whole ecosystems because without any trust without you know having to make sure that the uh platform is actually just to

make sure that the people the doctors the nurses can work much more efficiently, much more effectively. So there is no need for this and it's just like so the main thing that I would like

to point out is that having the new platform or having the new AI doesn't necessarily mean that it has to create more burden towards the doctors or towards the nurses. So it's just like

teaching someone to swim while they are already drowning. So it means that we have to realize that they have overloaded with the with the works with the responsibilities and so forth. Uh so

and last but not least I think related to Mrs. question is how to make the seamless collaboration between uh you know countries particularly when because I work in embassy of Indonesia so it

means that between Indonesia and India. So uh what I'm trying to say is that we doesn't it doesn't have uh to be we have to you know make a uniform systems uniform uh platforms.

No, it doesn't necessarily have to be that way, but it just simply means that seamless collaboration, you know, uh how that we can share, you know, AI works much better if we have uh a lot of uh

training data at hand, right? So, I think it would better if we can start that way. We have to uh think about it uh in uh again the seamless collaboration I think is the most

pivotal point on this matter. Uh thank you, Misha. &gt;&gt; Great. Thank you. And um I think um your um what you said about teaching people to swim while they're already drowning

is a great analogy because of course these tools are overwhelming for providers. Um and u I I think in other in other countries where where providers are being taught to use electronic

health records while they're providing care, the research shows that it really interferes with their quality of care, their perceived quality of care at least, right? because they're used to

seeing the patient. Now there's a screen between them and the patient. There isn't eye contact. There isn't the human touch feel and so on. So um I think that's a very good analogy. Um thank

you. Uh let's uh move on to Dr. Titipole. Um what are some of the training approaches when introducing uh digital and AI tools in primary healthcare contexts in the

context of of Thailand? Uh [clears throat] yeah perhaps I would want to mention this first when you look at look at the system in Thailand we have um the universal health care

coverage or it's called other names called 30 baselare scheme or the go-kart that actually provide access to to healthcare for people like um almost two decades ago. Um but it doesn't mean that

everyone have access proper access to healthcare services in in the country especially people in rural villages and now we but in addition to this we also have the so-cal village health care for

health volunteer that are working with the you know local health authorities and when we look at the roles of this um this group they have played quite significant roles in providing ing and

assisting local villages to have the primary cares and they are not digital digitally naive and they in Thailand we also have the so I think um I'm not sure if you are familiar with live

application and it's similar to WhatsApp that you are using here so this is one of the main mechanism that people um um will will let volunteers use and I think it is important to use the cap AI and to

play the roles in in this regard and how the government actually use um scrutinize and actually digest information because as we mentioned about the information you know from

medicals um journals and this kind of thing. So I think it is very important that if the ministry of health care in Thailand can actually help to digest information and how can we actually pass

through this information to this kind of application and the other platform that we have is called doctor at home and one of the main question that I have is now in Thailand we have a problem I

think similar to other places in the world that about the the circulation of information and many in in internet influencers in the country has been using this to mobilize their followers

and have circulate all kinds of health recommendations and that is one of the main challenge. So how can we actually control this and ensure that the you know like for example the case of uh

will health volunteers that they can get a proper reliable information and this is very important because you know they are the very first person who connect with villages and provide primary cares

and and their their roles is also to mitigate the the negative consequences of pick up false informations in villages as well. So in this regard it's it's a big question how can actually AI

um help to you know digest and uh scrutinize information for for these groups of workers in the front lines in in Thai villages. &gt;&gt; That's great. Thank you. uh and you

introduced the terms uh digital naive and digital native and I think uh that's a really important perspective uh of course because digital native population generally a younger population they know

how to use phones they know the basics of device maintenance um right like basic of any device maintenance they're digital native population but the digital naive population in most

countries they know how to use a particular app, right? They don't know how to maintain the device that the app sits on. Um, and often that is the fracture point in practice and that's

the piece that get gets missed out. So if you look at health workers where you've introduced this incredible app that's been spent with multi-million dollars of investment with the perfect

data with perfect user interface it cracks not because of the content of the app but because somebody hasn't figured out how to do virus updates or you know just like basic maintenance of

can't find the pictures can't find the windows can't remember their password has been locked out of their system and and so on and I think that's the basic basic digital literacy that eventually

um helps breakdown of the system. So um thank you. Um maybe uh Dr. Rancha I'll move on to you. Um in your current role as Chakra uh you're tasked with building centers of excellence to strengthen

education digital education but also previously in your role with Gabi you have worked across the world on a variety of digital programs. what are some of the gaps you've seen and how is

Chakra addressing some of these gaps in your current role? Uh thank you uh very much before I start on that when you on Gabi and Chakra I just wanted to comment that you

mentioned about people don't know their remember their password they don't know the app they forget this that sounded like me [laughter] so uh coming back to uh digital I mean I

was with Gabi the global alliance for vaccines and immunization in Geneva for almost 18 to 20 years and I recently retired and came back to the country and now only for 6 months I've been CEO of

uh Chakra. So one a little bit on chakra is that um you know the government of Maharashtra is setting up so many medical schools and colleges almost one in every district and uh we found that

you know there is faculties lacking I mean let's talk about AI which is another step but main core faculty is lacking. So what chakra aspires to do is uh promote educational excellence uh

also advance research because the our part research was missing and which will thereby improve patient care and this is a tall order and agenda but you know we are also harnessing the youth and the

energy and the brilliance that the youth bring to that. So we have a lot of um engagement and we offer a lot of courses on faculty development digital health and digit and AI are a couple of modules

there. We also do a lot of uh provide opportunities for um health tech technology uh and also of course uh research particularly on digital health and AI. There are couple of courses that

along with the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences we are offering to the minimum this thing is they have to be undergraduates. So it's more for post-graduates and all other allied

health services because the MUHS or Maharashtra University has more than 500 affiliated colleges and what we have seen is that in this age unless you embrace technology embrace the new tools

which are coming you will be completely overwhelmed. So it's really reading a workforce was learned practice probably like us in 20th century to practice in the 21st century with all these tools

that that's the um you know um agenda and through this chakra what we are doing is that we are offering a digital health foundation course uh and this is basically you have to be an

undergraduate this is entirely an online course and it's also published on the the it's all open source with all AI and digital health modules. Um thousands of uh ch I'm saying children thousands of

students have uh enrolled for it. It's also published on IGOD platform. It's their open uh source in our e-raodhini platform of the university. We also have a digital health foundation course for

nursing so that they are also uh responsible and aware of the tools which are out there and there is a new this thing we tested which is digital course um on health and that is really a

six-month certificate course where uh students do capstone project which you told me in the break that it's out of league already it's out of fashion uh but uh you know they choose the projects

and I saw that some of the health initiatives like the Aayushaman uh Bharat you know the digital health uh mission which they try to and you know they're trying to see how can some of

these government subsidies and um you know these schemes which are available how can students really avail of it and also the faculty so that much more primary health care uh workers are

involved in that awareness ness and they can avail of the services for greater good. Just because you mentioned Gabby uh you know Gabby works in more than 50 60 countries uh now uh all over the

world and uh we had already included in our grants and I used to look after the health systems uh portfolio at that time which is strengthening health systems in the country and already digitization and

primary health care was one of our tenants which we used to do and it's not only electronic health records. We used to call it electronic immunization registries. Uh but what we saw that if

you look at immunization dropouts, you know, we want um 100% immunization in all uh countries and in children. But there we found out if there was electronic health records then the WHO

standard of five to seven dropouts you know you are able to reach those children who are already enrolled and that the primary health care workers could do uh but that will not help us to

reach universal health coverage which was then again with government of India we worked a lot on you know they have the we started with the even platform the UI platform now there's a there was

a co-in platform So they have another platform is the maternal and child health programs. So how are all the vital registrations happening there and they're all by

primary healthcare workers who do it and there has to be an interoperability of these platforms so that really we reach out for universal health care and then uh and the primary health care workers

have a really key role in that. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much and thank you for the broader perspective as as well. Um um maybe just for for the

audience the comment on on capstone uh projects were of course capstones historically have been a medium through which learners can you remember back in the days we used to go to libraries

physical libraries. [laughter] So uh you know you'd go to the library maybe look up some books maybe u online library but now of course with the deep research uh online deep research you can

suggest a pretty good prompt and get the most sophisticated capstone so the quality of our capstones really went up in the last two years uh I don't think the quality of of thinking necessarily

did um associated that it was supposed to be the grand finale of most degrees you know you spend three to six months on it now you can spend three to six minutes on a on a much superior product.

So, uh just something something to think about. Um um okay. So, finally, uh thank you Dr. Monica Kosher. We've been waiting. [laughter]

We have a we have a good and insightful panel. Uh but um there are several areas where India has huge strengths. Uh I think especially in the IT space, right? And uh there are of course lots also to

learn from other countries and contexts and that's part of your your uh mandate with south south collaboration. So how are you fostering these interlinkages in as part of your role and what are the

areas of focus for you? &gt;&gt; Thank you Sisha. This is an important question and uh south collaboration goes a long way. Um so when we talk about India's strengths yes we are at the helm

of it uh with coin ABDM UI EIN um and uh uh very recently launched a AI guidance uh platform in health health care. I think uh we are there raring to go ahead but then is it just about us or is it

taking everybody along and that is the theme of the summit as well happiness for all welfare for all and that is somewhere where duction comes in. Dakshin, a platform um which was

launched by the honorable prime minister uh after the G20 uh presidency of India wherein after the voice of global south summit it was there was a realization that most of the global south countries

are struggling with similar challenges. They are all working in very very resource limited settings and it is about time that we stop reinventing the wheel all over the global south

countries and institutionalize the cooperation between the uh global south countries and that is how duction came into being. Now how do we work at dushen? So duction

convenes a structural exchange of ideas, a structural exchange of best practices. It is not just about India. It is about what we learn from others and how others learn from us. Learning the best

practices, the challenges, the limitations of all the global south countries together. So we bring in we bring in the think tanks, the educational institutes, researchers

and the technical uh partners as well on one single platform feeding into the research work the the the policies which are later on framed by the

government and which are evidence-based. We've been talking about evidence-based policies from quite some time. Now it's about time to work on it. And [clears throat] that is what Dakshin is

doing. We are enabling the global south countries through our think tank partners to analyze their uh gaps the gaps in their structure in their systems and how to strengthen them in the due

course of time. Um so it is not just about technology. It is also about system strengthening. It is not project based. It is about stren strengthening the complete ecosystem

which includes the primary health systems as well you know. So that is how the uh duction works in and that is how uh the collaborators and the think tanks are brought together. Why think tanks?

If you have this kind of a question in mind, think tanks because of their proximity with their respective governments. So G2G yes but then think tank to think tank uh evidence-based

policy framework. I think that is also important and that is how uh duction plays an important role in south of collaboration. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Uh, Professor

Anurag, you have I can tell that that you have many points to make and I welcome them. I have many things to follow up with you on. Uh, so those points and also I I want to ask you one

follow-up question to your earlier point. What is the one job that you think is going to disappear in the next few years? But you can you can you can answer that last. I'll give you time to

answer that. Okay, [laughter] &gt;&gt; I'll give a general purpose answer to the last one come before I go. So, anybody who sits entirely on a keyboard to do their job, their job is at risk of

disappearing. And that could be any job where you sit only on a keyboard because what you do on it can probably be mimicked by an AI and that's I'm borrowing from Elon Musk's views on that

one. But let me come to one thing that I think we unset. When we thought about education for building a health workforce, we talked about problems of global south

and the challenges we face. But we never spoke about health entrepreneurs. People who build worldclass products that the global north will use.

Until we change the mindset in our education and training of our workforce to at least develop one product that the global north would use, we are anyway going to stay with all global south

problems forever. Wealth is one of the differences between the global north and global south. A global south health strategy should not ignore the importance of creating

solution that generate wealth for the globe what is currently the global south and this kind of entrepreneurship education aspiration cutting edge training is as much part and which is

why when the health strategy sah was launched yesterday we actually have innovation over regulation right as one of our points cuz we could go in many directions but real innovation at the

cutting edge and for this who's going to make it right medical doctors can be service providers they can be enabled by AI to become better service providers there's no problem on that but can

people with an understanding of the problems of health be enabled in their educational curriculum perhaps not necessarily inside the medical college perhaps by combinations like we are

building with additional courses the quite foundation is working with MUHS and many others to look at what is not yet done and where our numbers can come into play and

we seeing that happen in variety of sectors right in fintech etc. Why not help? Now coming to the job that will is most at risk. I would at least say consultancy.

&gt;&gt; Okay. About time. [laughter] &gt;&gt; About time. Um you know u so many thoughts on entrepreneurship. Um our program we have about um maybe 60 Indian students uh

every year and they all have startup dreams. Um and I think one model that has worked very well and and and we have that here too is combining uh medical healthcare with technologists but

putting them in the same room having startup ecosystem where they can communicate talk to each other identify problems and so there's a lot of practice based learning um but a lot of

students come out of the program with with startups with a use case that is somewhat functional. So uh yeah please I turn over to you Dr. Ranch. &gt;&gt; Thank you. You know this question and

what our Indonesian colleagues sort of said it struck to me that we are entering into a world of lot of interdependencies and their interdependencies of

technology with healthcare which we are all concerned about and we need to move that with times and I'll give one example because I've been Switzerland for so many years you know the Swiss

medical school in their I think fourth year or so before they go to final MBBS they actually have a semester in the technology institute &gt;&gt; so that they learn the technology the

devices what are you know the 21st century and that's mandatory for them to be graduate out of medical school and here in chakra what we saw was that we had partnership with kota foundation

with IIT Mumbai because the courses on technology which were being offered they actually are meant for healthare workers. So for IIT Mumbai then the technologists would take those course

and not the health health professionals. So I think that kind of understanding the interdependencies and leveraging those to our benefit to the benefit of the healthcare is really

important as we go along. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yeah and that's that's a great point to understand interdependencies. You really need to have I think what people say soft skills. I like to think of them as

power skills, right? They are not skills you can sit doing at a computer. And so if you think about uh the large uh tech technology firms, of course, the lower level coders, those jobs, if you're

mediocre, that job can be automated, right? If you're a more sophisticated coder, but if you're a manager, you're likely to keep your job because you need to work with people and machines. And

that's uh I think the same is true for health care where all of these studies are saying that LLMs are much better than physicians at empathy and you know how do we change that? We

have this large clock ticking in front of me. Um, and I want to just turn over to another rapid fire round to the panelists to say talk about just the the one sort of shift that you see that

needs to happen in health workforce training in your context and I'm giving you maybe I'll start with Dr. Mona in the middle. [clears throat] [laughter] Okay. Um I wish we could just

change the hierarchical system in the healthcare. Everybody is equal. Everybody can talk to anybody without thinking. I think that is one thing because we are the most hierarchical

uh the system. I think if we can change that I think automatically everything will be [laughter] at at par &gt;&gt; and the digital naives might learn

something. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter] &gt;&gt; So uh Dr. Teddy &gt;&gt; I think it if we look at in the context of Thailand decentralization of power is

important because different region have different healthcare concerns. So I think uh when we talk about the locals um workers in villages then they should have more authority to decide what is

actually or is best for them or what should be educate um people's in in villages because in currently now everything is controlled by ministry of health and in Thailand. So I think it's

decentralization of information is very important. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. And Dr. Ranja &gt;&gt; I think one thing which really needs to I I agree with what Dr. Mona said I 100%

agree to that but I think we need to do away with this fear complex. So [laughter] I really I mean question because you know the human centeredness of health care will never go away.

&gt;&gt; Anybody would like to have that human touch and a health professional than talking to a computer. So that will never go away. So one thing we really need to change is befriend the tools.

Befriend the tools. use them to your advantage uh to go ahead in the 21st century. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh maybe I'll start here with you Dr. Fu.

&gt;&gt; All right. Uh thank you. I just want to point out that at the end of the day, doctors are the ones that help responsible for the decisions they make. So it means that the the to make use or

to rely 100% on the on the products of AI is actually you know uh too much. So, so that's my point. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so accountability really is for Dr. Anarak

&gt;&gt; rise of liberal arts and critical thinking. &gt;&gt; Yes. [laughter] No conflict of interest, [laughter] Dr. Monica.

&gt;&gt; I think uh trust in the digital systems by the health workforce would also be important. Ultimately the systems are being done prepared for the people to work on and if they adopt the systems

that would really be helpful. uh having worked with the uh workforce uh at the at the front line you know I've realized that they are still skeptical to the use of these AI systems and we need to earn

their trust first &gt;&gt; that's a great summary and with with knowledge comes trust and so um I think uh with that maybe can we have a round of applause please for this panel

[applause and cheering] Um &gt;&gt; okayally they are involved. learning research.

This is my research. I'm doing my program. &gt;&gt; Great. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. But I will learn.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much for your question. &gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe. Yes, please. &gt;&gt; I think all your points are very well taken and when we train the health

workforce, we shall make sure that these things about the limitations of the AI models are communicated and the fact that all models are flawed, some are useful is made more obvious. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. I think um &gt;&gt; yeah let's let's take the different hospital okay &gt;&gt; this is also required

&gt;&gt; great thank you very much for your thank you very much thank You [applause]
