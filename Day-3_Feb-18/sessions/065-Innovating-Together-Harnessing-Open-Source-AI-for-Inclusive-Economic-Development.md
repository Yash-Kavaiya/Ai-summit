## 📝 Transcript

standards and open AI systems which adhere to privacy and other applicable arts do no harm by design and help to attain the sustainable development goals. The digital public good standard

is uh this def definition made operational. So every open source product that wants to become a digital public good is vetted against the standard of nine indicators.

And against this backdrop, I am delighted to see that a lot of the work that has been done on uh the guidelines that we are launching today is actually quite well connected to the DBG

standard. So there's strong alignment and today in fact is a milestone because we are here to officially release the policy brief advancing open-source AI in India recommendations for governments

and technology developers. Let me contextualize this work. India and the world are standing at a critical juncture in developing, governing and deploying artificial intelligence.

The brief that we are launching here today examines the critical role of openness in AI systems to facilitate responsible communitydriven AI development that truly serves the public

good. It also discusses barriers and challenges of open source AI and makes clear that openness in itself is not an end but a means for social and economic development. The policy off brief offers

concrete recommendations for policy makers and developers alike and it was jointly developed by the India AI mission fair forward digital futures lab NASCOM and a group of esteemed expert

and an advisory board. This said, it's now my great pleasure to welcome Dr. Be Kofla, Parliamentary State Secretary at the German Federal Ministry for Economic Operation and

Development to contextualize this work and address the essential role of open source AI in strengthening global collaboration and advancing social and economic development. Miss Kra,

[applause] &gt;&gt; thank you very much. Madam moderator I have to say well colleagues partners distinguished guests I'm very happy to be here and to open

also this session looking forward to the conversation you as the expert on the topic we'll have at the end of that uh session on the panel um the advancing opensource AI in India report is not

just another report we know that quite well we've seen and we see the proof proof uh of the great cooperation between India and Germany and and that's maybe also at the same uh level

important it is shared is it is a shared road map on open AI development our cooperation does matter for artificial intelligence developers in Bangalore and in Berlin and to the

community in the world because an AI built in the open enables all stakeholders to benefit benefit from it and not just a few large tech companies. That's I think something we

also have to learn in those days. This is especially valuable given the great extent of AI inequality. Many countries regard their progress on AI uh as an as an arms race and work on

it secretly. But this leaves many many people in many countries, many societies behind. The numbers are very clear. According to the World Bank, countries representing just

17% of the world's population account for 91% of AI venture capital and 87% of the significant AI models. Yet, there is a great economic potential in closing those gaps. The World Trade

Organization estimates that the global GDP could rise by up to 13% by 2040 if I AI devices are bridged. Trade would be boosted by nearly 30 40%. Open-source AI is a mean is a means to

democratic technological innovation and overcome AI inequality. It allows developers worldwide to build on the shoulders of those who did the work before without needing million

dollar compute budgets. When training data or documentation are shared openly, both the local and the global community can test systems, detect risk, detect bias, and ensure

accountability. This transparency fosters uh oh sorry I cannot read my own handwriting [laughter] fosters trust you know without the

glasses it's a challenge sometimes fosters trust and trust is what turns technology into impact without it AI remains unused or contested from a country perspective open source

strengthens digital sovereignity because it allows each country to adapt AI on its own linguistic, economic and regulatory needs. And well, we could ask the question why

that is important for the cooperation in between India and Germany. It is of utmost importance for us and for our cooperation. Uh we see and we appreciate very much the India's AI for all

philosophy that is well aligned to our own priorities. in Germany. We are working for artificial intelligence that is open, inclusive, and representative. Together, we are shaping the future of

artificial intelligence with the conviction that AI inequality isn't just a tech issue. It's a power issue. The German government is proud to contribute to the growing open AI ecosystem in

particular through was mentioned fair forward initiative. Our goal is open up AI to everyone and to make it drive sustainable development. I would say fair forward is a success

story and Indian partners are of course part of it. Let me give you two examples small examples what we could achieve so far. We have shared for example 16 open AI building blocks for climate action

including artificial intelligent tools that helps to protect first here concretely in India in Goa against wildfires or second example we have made 55 AI

data sets available as digital public goods so innovators can build on local AI solutions that help for example to better to reap better crops track disease pieces access government

services in local languages which is of utmost importance. Fair forward shows why an open-source ecosystem is strong when one partner improves a model or a data set everybody

can build on it. This stands in stark contrast to a competitive artificial intelligent arms arms race that would produce only a few winners while leaving very many behind.

Well, ladies and gent gentlemen, open-source AI is a prerequisite for more equitable and sustainable development. It focuses on collaboration, transparency and

inclusion, giving power to many rather than con concentrating in a few hands and thus thus is it enables and drives democratic processes worldwide. I think actually that's something the world is

needed now. Democratic processes have to be driven forward. The report shows that this is the way to do it. This is the way forward. Let us use it as a common frame to references and grow and grow

this community of practice across countries, across sectors and across languages. Thank you very much. May I now invite everyone who was part of the process of developing the AI uh

the policy brief. Um so Dr. Kofler um representatives from GZ digital futures lab NASCOM and from the working group on stage for the launch of the policy brief and the photo opportunity.

Please Yeah. Come closer. We will now transition to our panel discussion. Um we will um look at the

opportunities and constraints of open source AI in the context of India and the work of the um policy group. So may I ask uh to join me here on stage please?

Amanda Prog, Chief Executive Officer of Open UK. James Love Growth, director at Redhead. [applause] Dr. Peter Metson, founder and president, ML Commons, and staff

engineer at Google. [applause] Mr. Shagalingam, director technology Nuscom, [applause] Miss Yasha Kandelva, CEO and founder of tech for BIS [applause]

and Arushi Gupta, senior policy senior research manager at digital futures lab. What is it? &gt;&gt; Okay. So,

&gt;&gt; yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. We need another photo with Dr. Kofla. I was just told. [laughter] I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Hopefully.

Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; So, now that we've [clears throat] Yes, it's working. Okay, great. So now that we've done the photo

opportunities, let's uh move on to the discussion part and let's start with the foundations and that is defining openness in AI which is um not such an easy task and um Amanda you've done

quite a bit of work around uh this part with open uh UK AI systems are complex with several interlin components such as data models and weights and um when we begin to unpack what the term openness

in AI means We face yeah several open questions around open data for instance um the role of open weights and all that but maybe let's start with why is it

actually important to have definitional clarity around this term in the first place. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much for having me along today and uh I wish you the best of luck

with the report. Um, I think that it's really important to understand what openness is because it has values that are fundamental to it that underly it, which is how it's

achieved success. So, if we're looking at that from a community perspective where when we're building something, we want everybody to be able to use it and share it and rely trust. And that trust

piece is very important because often we move to open source because we want to create access for all. We want to have innovation that everyone can use. And you know in the last panel they were

talking about a new form of open washing where digital public good which we've just heard has a very clear meaning is being misused. civic tech, various terms of public good are being misused without

clear definition and people are being misled. And I think 2026 in many ways may become the year of the ontology because as a community, as individuals, we need to be able to rely on what open

source is. And we we need to be able to take whatever is shared with us openly, use it in confidence, and know we can pass it on for others to use in the same way. And that's fundamental for our

trust, but it's also fundamental if you want the innovation to succeed because that's what's created the adoption of open-source at scale. That's why the engineers gather around it. And I think

too often when we look at these uh definitions, we we have people who aren't really part of that community building definitions and what we actually have to do is dig deep into the

community to understand why because we have to have certainty. And if we look at for example the laws in the EU, they give um certain benefits. They they hold open source to a slightly different

standard from other technologies. So we have to have clarity in what we're talking about. And I think the way we do that also has to involve very clear nonisolationist

uh approaches. So we can't be collaborating only as a couple of countries. We need a global conversation around this and you know various people have already tried to drive that but we

need to get to this globally accepted understanding that the communities will accept as well as the policy makers of what these terms are so that we have trust and reliance and we're all having

conversations from that same perspective. I'm seeing nodding so I'm hoping that made sense. I think it's back to you, isn't it?

You're going to ask a question. Although, I'd like to ask myself a question that makes life much easier. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Um, and uh, yes, I mean, we are here at the AI impact

summit, right? And this is about global collaboration. This is about bringing to people together to exactly have these uh, conversations. So, I'm really happy that you brought up uh, this point. I

would like to pass it on to um Arushi now to discuss what openness can actually achieve. Um it's often positioned as a lever to reduce dependence and on so-called big tech.

And Dr. Dr. Kofla also mentioned digital serenity as one important um means that uh open source and AI can um can achieve and um from your perspective as a civil society organization um but also working

closely with governments. Um what can openness realistically offer to governments but also to people coming from an understanding of digital soenity both for states but also for people.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh thanks Leia. Thanks so much for the question and of course I'm also going to going to build upon some of the discussions that we had in the previous panel around resilience and sovereignty

and Amanda in fact opened up that panel by saying I don't like the term sovereignty and I'm just going to piggyback on it but before I sort of unpack what sovereignty means and what

it what its connection is with openness I think it's worth unpacking the marriage or rather unhappy marriage between open source AI and the big tech right uh throughout the work we've done

as part of this report it was a recurring question in terms of what are the limitations in ensuring openness and AI when we know the reality around us where a lot of the infrastructure

compute engineering talent is concentrated amongst a small set of actors right and even when the entire stack uh including models data sets are made open and they're increasingly are

within the Indian context. Can smaller players, individual actors realistically build models given that the resources that are needed to build an open-source system lie with the people who are not

very interested in building the open-source system. Right? So that's part one and what we tried to do in this policy brief uh that you'll also read is we had like three symptoms of these

limitations. One is of course the infrastructural dependencies but the other is the ability to extract value. So when we have open artifacts, data sets, models in fact applications who

and which actor is picking up these data sets and building on top of it. It's more likely than not that it's always better resourced actors, big tech actors, companies who are most capable

of sort of using an open data set, adding value to it, building a service on top and generating intellectual rents off of it. Right? So there's also a power asymmetry in who

benefits from openness. the coming very quickly to the sovereignty question as well. Um, one thing is that and something that I also want to cover in terms of Amanda's point is

countering big tech can also lead to the risk of another form of big tech which is the Orurveian big brother right one is big tech concentration or corporate concentration and the other is state

concentration we within the global south majority world do not want either right we want a decentralized pluralistic community of developers and that has to come in a much more democratized

fashion. It has to come from public infrastructure. It has to come from multiple multiple communities of developers being incentivized and being and collaborating together. The last bit

is also in terms of what would it take us to get there, right? Um, I often see the big tech question being dealt with through the open-source channel, but there are many other ways to counter big

tech, right? It's not just openness. It's also competition policy. It's also investments in open infrastructures. So, that's just the last point in terms of having a very singular connection

between big tech and sovereignty. Yeah. Back to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So just as you've mentioned me there, I'd just like very very quickly respond before you go to the

next question. I don't agree with that point about big tech. So the value of openness is that it allows iterative development and that iterative development is something that means

small innovators innovate on top of opensource and that's how they challenge and we build true competition and innovation through openness. And it's evidenced and it's

evidenced over recent history and software where we see the big techs buy up all the small innovators in Europe in other countries and they do that because small companies are better at innovating

in many ways than the big techs are and that's what openness allows. So I think it's almost the oppos opposite that big tech isn't a problem when it comes to openness. If the technology is open

small individuals and communities will innovate. Let's actually hear from a startup founder uh about this topic. Gasha um you are a founder of an AI company.

So what uh what can open source realistically meaningfully do for startup for smallsized uh players um against larger uh tech companies? Is it really leveling the playing field or how

do you experience it from a practical perspective? &gt;&gt; So leveling Can you guys hear me? Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. So,

leveling partially is correct. Um, equalized leveling is definitely not correct. So, for startups and midsize companies like us, I mean, um, the barrier to entry has been entirely

removed. You know, you don't need a billion dollar infrastructure requirement. You can take an existing model, deploy it to an environment, ship up an application, and that's that's

there to it, right? So, this is amazing when it comes to open-source. Now the second part here is we've been able to do tremendously tremendously amazing innovation in the downstream part of the

application development. The secondary part which is the foundational layer is still concentrated in the hands of few. uh when I say the foundational layer I mean the pre-training of the base models

uh designing architectures retraining them right they're pretty much in the hands of few big companies for many obvious reasons that you need compute inensive resources you need um

proprietary data sets which you can or cannot get it and then obviously you need a good R&amp;D lab setup which is equivalently required to make that happen. So it's pretty obvious that you

know some companies will have advantage over this but here is the demarcation and I sort of want attention to this part. We've seen this trajectory before uh as far as India is concerned. We know

manufacturing and pharma company when we started there we were never innovators or we didn't start as innovators in both the verticals. We started as adopters right? So you start by adopting

something then you start working towards its execution. So we became really great in the execution for manufacturing and pharma companies and then slowly slowly we focused and pivoted our understanding

towards the upstream which was R&amp;D. So thanks to open-source AI, we can precisely and I mean precisely repeat the trajectory here by using what is available with the open-source and then

start building on top of it to build uh the intellisense of the upstream. Um how are we going to do this? This is the most important question. It'll only happen and I mean that seriously. It'll

only happen when the mindset of the when the mindset of the entire country or the globe changes that we're not being, you know, consumers of AI. We have to think like producers for AI. And how do you go

about producing AI goes back to the basics of the maths that you have to focus on you know uh putting efforts to the foundation layer start contributing to the open-source community a lot more

by pre-training the weights maybe providing I don't know um localized language globalizers doing a ton of innovation around the architecture I mean we have um a ton of

innovation happening in architecture with JPA model and the likes um AGI AMI is coming. So start focusing on those core architectures and then and then the most important part comes here is that

focus your shift from the downstream technology more on the upstream so that you're not waiting for the innovation to come here but you become the source of innovation right so I mean hats off open

source has been um really really helpful is how I would like to sum this up. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much ya that does really great to hear and uh I love your point

also about contributing back. Yeah, please. [applause] In fact, contributing back is also a core part of what we uh do with the digital public goods alliance and our

product owner um community. It's something that we really want to strengthen um through our work. And um I also really the point yeah the point that you made around moving basically

from access uh to technology to technology agency really resonates um with me as well. I also want to throw in another topic here James uh that is for you. Um but we talked now about access

we talked about agency. Let's talk also about trust and um challenges um that may come with um open source as well. So I've been uh part of the um definition process of open source AI with OSI and

one of the topics that came up repeatedly apart from the data discussion was the risk of open sourcing AI. Um from your work in the ME region how should policy makers industry and

civil society navigate this tension between um a yeah making value creation available through open sourcing versus balancing also the risk. So what I've noticed, first of all,

thanks for having me. What I've noticed is that any room that talks about open source, it's standing room only. Um it's a common theme throughout the summit. So there's something going on. Um and I

think also tomorrow's declaration hopefully will will reflect that the importance of open source and more than that the criticality of open source and its global nature. And so to your

question around uh the definitions these established uh terms and notions which have been around for a long time I want just to riff on what Yasha was saying in terms of repeat the trajectory. So I

think from uh Red Hat's perspective with was uh leading open source solution provider is that we'd like to see a repeat of what happened with regards to Linux and the operating system. We'd

like to see a repeat what we're seeing already now in the cloud space and with Kubernetes and then why not in um emerging technologies. I mean not just AI but a bunch of other technologies

using that kind of open-source approach. Uh so I think that was one one point I wanted to riff off. Uh the other was um again these trade-offs. Uh uh so Amanda was mentioning around sort of values and

open washing and legal certainty in the EU since we have a strong German um contingent here. Um I think that's quite an interesting uh reflection. Um so I'll I'll just make two points on that. So,

first of all, with regards to the EU, we did quite a lot of work um on securing an upstream exemption for open source uh in the AI act, but it's extremely narrow and I think partly because open source

wasn't fully understood. Um it's still in the process of being understood. Um and I think there's an upcoming regulation the cloud and AI development act and also the procurement review

where I think to your point we want to make sure that there is this global understanding of this community it's 180 million plus uh by 2030 I think a third of that will be in India but also it

will be as relevant to to your point about being Bangalore or Berlin the two can collaborate and work together and solve problems that actually no single country region or company can solve

alone. So I think that upstream first approach sharing um in the communities is absolutely vital. Um and maybe just an example of that. So with Red Hat we've got uh a number of projects

obviously um all of our uh technologies upstream first and uh we've got the VLM LMD. This is all about inferencing engines. It's about making sure that we're not dependent on the hardware

under under underlay. uh it's about also the point that was made earlier about the energy consumption concerns that we have and then maybe just closing by yes okay the EU sometimes nilally called the

kind of global regulator u but in a sense there there is an opportunity if you get it right in Brussels uh you get it right um further a field I think it's also important that India um here also

has that exact role and that was the point that was made in the previous panel I think is is actually just as important in the global south um on these kinds of terms in terms of

reflecting the realities of what open source actually means um and taking leadership uh there. But again, I'm going say it could also be just as relevant to the global north too. So

getting these kinds of notions and terms entrenched in these kinds of declarations um is absolutely vital to kind of really fully unlock the the the full potential of AI using using open

source. So back to you Leah. Thank you. Thank you so much uh James um for this elaboration and also bringing in again global collaboration. I think that is really a common theme uh here that we

see throughout uh the summit. Um let me bring in another perspective um as well and that's related to trust um but at a different level and uh Peter you do also work on benchmarking and when we debate

how models perform um their capabilities we yeah usually go to evaluations we go to benchmarkers we go to leaderboards to see which one is is performing best um how should we think about transparency

reproducibility and robustness and benchmarking and if you could also elaborate a bit more about open versus closed benchmarking and benchmarking contamination. I think this would be

really beneficial uh to understand the important role and also what openness uh can achieve here. &gt;&gt; Thank you uh and thank you for having me here today. I think that's a great uh

great question. Um I want to talk a little bit first about the why uh why we should care about measuring things related to trust. Uh this is both a worthy thing to do in and

of itself. It's also the chief driver of adoption for AI. Um right now we can build AI systems um that can do amazing things. Um but where they have challenges is in the area of

reliability. Um, will they always give uh a safe response when asked a hazardous question? Will they uh always provide security when they're used in a um an

application where they have access say to private data or to say someone's credit card number? Um will they um always behave correctly um especially in high-risisk areas such as healthcare.

Right? It's our ability to build reliable systems that drives trust and trust drives adoption. So that's why this matters. Um then there's the question of how do you measure uh

reliability? Um and that's where benchmarks come in. Um and at the ML Commons Association, we've done a lot of work uh with a lot of different people. Uh we have members ranging from from Red

Hat to Microsoft. So in some sense we're on uh you know uh uh many sides of of the discussion here. Um but one thing we all have a common interest in is having good metrics because nothing drives

progress like a common metric. Uh otherwise you have people shouting at each other with different numbers. Um but if you can come together and you can agree this is how we're going to measure

something then you can move it. Um it's really an amazing amazing thing that metrics do. Um, benchmarking for AI is a really interesting

area to grapple with openness. Um, you definitely want an open and transparent process for defining the benchmark. However, you get into some very interesting challenges when you try and

make for instance the prompt data set fully open because what you will see is you will see people um overfitting very rapidly. You can always train your model to be good on the test. It's like if you

give a student the the exam in advance, uh they they will do really really well, but that may not be indicative of their uh their actual knowledge or ability. So, we've tried to do uh things like

create a bunch of effectively test questions, divide it into a practice test, which we make available, and an official test that we don't um uh to try and provide openness. At the same time,

uh we provide uh accurate results on uh benchmarks. Um, and we've tried to do that for areas like uh uh product safety with the AI eliminate safety benchmark. Um,

increasingly for security with things like AI eliminate jailbreak. Um, we're really trying to give everyone these common metrics um that people can use in a fair way. Um, but which still uh still

is a an accurate indicator. Um, related to this, I do actually have two challenges for the open community. Um, one of those challenges is there's a question of what we are measuring when

we use one of these benchmarks. If you measure a proprietary system, you're measuring something that has a model surrounded by guardrails and other things that try and keep it more safe

and secure. And there's been a a tremendous flowering of open models. And so one of my challenges for the open community is can we also see open guard rails and open complete systems. So we

can measure uh measure the performance of what someone could take off the shelf and be ready to deploy to make their company or their venture successful. Um right now we're we're offering people

cars which is great but you have to install the locks and the seat belts yourself. Um and it would be wonderful to see um you know open systems uh in the AI space that have those locks and

seat belts and then we can have you know an open uh transparent metric driven uh uh path to progress. Um the other challenge um that I would throw out is uh we've heard people

talking about the data too which is is truly crucial um to delivering um progress on reliability. Uh it's not the Pythons that's the code in these systems. It's the data. The data is the

code. Um, and Emil Commons has produced the first AI, let's call it metadata format that enables people to uh programmatically access data sets in a common way. And so if you go to sites

like HuggingFace, uh you'll see a little croissant. It's the croissant format and that's the the common descriptor for these data sets. And another thing we'd love to see is a lot of open data

tooling, right? How do you help people build good data sets for whatever their application is? Uh whether it's tailoring to a particular language um supporting an application in

agriculture, the ability to reason about that data and to empower people depends on having good tools the same way that good software tools have enabled uh more and more developers around the world. So

those those are my challenges uh to folks in this room. Could we see uh you know full open AI systems that include uh security and product safety guardrails? Um could we see a flowering

of uh open data tooling uh to help people build uh more reliable um uh systems and and drive adoption. So thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much uh for this

elaboration. And I want to actually throw in another challenge uh here and that is benchmarking in the wild as uh some call it. What we usually do is we um make model evaluations but we do it

in a lab context. What we don't do is to really assess how these systems then perform like in real world contexts especially in a global majority context. So I think there's another challenge

that the um international open source community in AI needs to address to make AI um really work uh for everyone especially here uh in in the global south. Um I want to piggyback on what

you said around um off-the-shelf solutions and um basically um delivering open components and open tooling um that then companies can use and uh pass it on to uh Shukalingam um to hear from the

private sector perspective. So um what is your experience with NASCOM? Where do companies in the Indian context feel comfortable using open components, open models and where do you still see uh

challenges and things that need to be fixed? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for this opportunity. So enterprise adoption right in in open assessing it it is in three categories

right all three categories together if it is drive speed innovation and cost efficiency if three these three things go together enterprise adop all these open source tools right if you see all

the infrastructure component today like vinx or your containers or your I mean kubernetes all are open today right and then if your data stack is open your kafka your apache spark all these are

open today Even some of the APIs uh uh companies enterprises are willing to share because of the digital public infrastructure what we have today right and second we

all know the predominantly models are open predominantly there are a lot of open source models available where we have the closeness right the data right which is the enterprise data

where I have the customer information which I can't share my business logic and the edge which I'm making the profit so That's that's a kind of thing which which cannot be shared. That's a closed

thing today. Second is the uh I can say even DevOps tools are open today but the dev sec ops some of those dev sec ops tools are not open today right I mean the guardrail comes under your dev sec

ops right and ML comments work on the harms uh taxonomy but even some of them are even close today. So those are the challenges. One, how you build a write if else statements for your LLM output,

right? I mean that's that's a big secret today, right? I mean because your LLM uh hallucinates and then it doesn't produce the same result of every iteration, right? Even though you control your top

EK values and temperature to zero, it still hallucinates, right? That that challenge is still there. So that somebody has to find out a right mechanism to

control. Yeah. So we discussed the opportunities. We also have a table full of challenges. Let's uh move it on towards operationalizing openness uh in AI and

that's a question I have for all my panelists um here and just looking at the time there um please be concise uh in your answers. So if we step back from individual actors whether it's

developers um companies or governments or civil society what you see as the most single most important systemic barrier slowing down the meaningful adoption currently of openness and open

source AI and what would it take collectively um to move past that constraint maybe what's your one bold move uh that we need in 2026 to overcome this barrier

&gt;&gt; I can say in two words trust readiness gap gap that's trust readiness gap that's one one two word we can say &gt;&gt; um I think this is a super interesting conversation and I had the opportunity

also to read the report last night and I I I really welcome the report it's something that's in line with last week the European Commission had over 1,600 responses the most it's ever had in

history to its consultation on open source which is all public and open UK has been working in the UK for the last year with UK arrive doing the same sort of thing and I I think that the biggest

challenge the issue that we have is a lack of understanding of open source and it's because the open source community you know you were putting out challenges to us we're poorly represented we are a

community in an ecosystem that is huge and it's not like going and consulting a single company that has policy people a lot of money to attend meetings and to always be in the

And I think you know even looking at the experts in the report the open source community that I know in India the leaders I know one of whom was on the last session with us Mishi Foss United

the you know the obvious partners aren't part of that and it's not a me too thing. It's that if you don't bring those people into the room you will never learn how it works. And whilst the

report goes some way towards some of the necessary steps that you need if you want to be successful in open source, it only goes some way. So I think it's a fantastic first step, but there's very

clear next actions. And all you have to do is look at China and the way that China has approached open source in the last decade which has been very public and very clear. And one of the first

things they've done is build a national foundation which I don't think is in your suggestions and it is in our suggestions in the UK. They've built open atom and you suddenly then have a

code holding organization in your geography and that's not about localizing. What that's about is engaging globally so that you can be a leader and take that leadership and I

think you're absolutely spot on with that. You have more skilled people than almost any country in the world but you don't have enough leaders. you don't have enough businesses here and to build

that you need to have the things that concentrate power and one of those is having the foundations that hold the the projects that manages the governance of the project and goes out to the rest of

the world to collaborate from and I think there's a lot of gaps in the report in terms of the activities that are needed because you didn't engage enough with that local open source

community in India and I I think that understanding of how open source has worked how it's been built and how It's scaled. It's very geeky. It's very nerdy. It's very specific. But there are

people who know how to do it and they really need to be brought more into the conversation. &gt;&gt; I think there was there was an applause happening there. So carry on. [applause]

Yeah. So um if I could just uh add to that. So um in terms of Redup we are perhaps the perhaps the largest percentage of revenue R&amp;D um right up there with the pharmaceutical

uh the difference is we have thousands of patents they're all unrestricted uh all our software is based on copy left permissive licensing and and that's really important means that anyone who

uses the software customer partner upstream community and they modify and contribute to it they have to then share share it back. Um, and that builds out a huge huge huge huge community. So around

our products, I think we have something like seven or eight million people. Uh, you couldn't employ 78 million people as a as a as a company. But these folks are absolutely dedicated to improving that

product. They play with it. They're also perfectly entitled to fork it, move it away, create another community. some clone it which is a little bit uh uh painful sometimes because you want to

get them to to you know push back ideas upstream. Um but nonetheless uh then the point about sort of how many people actually are full-time on on policy impacting uh a red or an open source

company or or the community more more widely. I think there probably couple of handful that's about it right um and so hence that's so in it that's I think the reason why sometimes uh regulators

unintentionally uh create these kinds of gaps um it's not a lack of intelligence or a lack of of of of willingness it's it's actually on us um

&gt;&gt; we mentioned submarines &gt;&gt; submarines we can go back summary second and then and then I think the but that said since even though we're the largest on earth we would never ever claim to be

representative. Um, we're just part of the community and we work with everyone as equals and the best ideas generally and genuinely come from everywhere. So that bleeds also into um open-source AI.

I think again we could go out there and say it's this um I think we just have this sort of softly softly approach because again it took many years for the Linux uh definitions to work. Oh yes,

I'd say that, you know, the minimum criteria is open-source licensed model weights combined with open source components. But that's just a a starting point and I think there's more to build

on that and I'm going to hand the mic on. &gt;&gt; I have to say some apparently &gt;&gt; I actually think your summary was was really great. Um it is uh push

reliability um push readiness uh you know a aim for a turnkey system and not some assembly required to get something that you can deploy in a trusted application that is

that is significantly enabling to a lot of people. um and uh would love to see uh the whole AI ecosystem moving forward on trust and reliability as measured by rigorous metrics. Um I think we have uh

we look at our our own community, our own uh things we're excited about. But as humans, our obligation, our greater obligation with something as impactful as AI is to come together and make

progress on uh trust, reliability, security, product safety um to learn how to do these important things as this technology advances. So I think Amanda has covered everything

I would want to speak about but surely focusing on the upstream is what I'd like to um end my part of the discussion with. &gt;&gt; Um yeah I think I'll maybe I'll cover

what's left in terms of what we need to go ahead. One of the and I one of the things that we also discuss in the policy brief is of course openness as one of the levers for sovereignty but

also openness as a lever for governance of AI systems right openness also engenders transparency and what we argue in the policy brief is that when we see within India particularly there are a

lot of public sector AI deployments and within this context it's really important to institutionalize openness whether It means privileging openness through procurement frameworks. Whether

it means uh put specifically looking at data sets, ensuring that they are well documented, ensuring that their lineage is clearly clearly mapped when they're hosted on public platforms as well as

ensuring that the applications that we're building are of course catering to a diverse set of languages which is automatically something that openness ensures right which is looking at

multiple plural languages and catering to them. Um the other bit in terms of just what we need to sort of really push the envelope to ensure that openness is really embraced is I think a move away

from self-interest right we have within the Indian context within global south context there's a lot of competition in this space right uh as is also seen in the expo right everybody wants to

produce and sort of showcase their product but the in the end of the day it's also in essential to have a more collaborative spirit, right? Whether it is in terms of data sets being shared,

whether it is in terms of sort of applications and source code being put out and shared. So yeah, I'll I'll end on that note. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Arushi. And um just

coming quickly back on the topic of trustworthy AI, I think you're also launching a network on trustworthy AI uh for the global south, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. Uh and thank you for like just

giving me a launching pad to talk about that network. So on the 20th in fact we along with siri from IIT Madras international innovation corp global center on AI governance as well as IT

Rio in Brazil are launching a global south network for trustworthy AI and the plan there is to really bring civil society organizations across the global south together uh for a variety of

things starting with of course I know this panel already covered is benchmarking but moving towards more contextualized benchmarks and safety eval EV valuations that are more attuned

to the realities and the harms and vulnerabilities that the global south is currently facing and perhaps would not be catered to by elite institutions in the global north. We also plan to do a

lot of capacity building work when it comes to AI risk mitigation as well as evaluating AI systems. And the third is of course knowledge and uh sharing of frameworks right and I do there was bit

of talk around having common methodologies and common metrics and I feel like the network is also going to work towards ensuring that we're not repeating the similar methodologies and

reinventing the wheel every single time and we know that a lot of the concerns that governments and developers in Brazil are facing is very similar to the Indian context very similar to what

concerns Malaysian and as well as Laos Cambodian developers are facing right so the idea is to really come together as a multi-reional multistakeholder platform &gt;&gt; yes thank you and reusing what others

are doing is actually a core open source practice so that is lift uh in the network that's really great to see um I have the pleasure now of wrapping up uh the session we talked about many

different topics I think each of them um merits a deeper discussion um so um let's let's do that after the session here I just want to mention a few things and uh please forgive me um if we are um

if that is not uh totally um concluding everything that we are saying. So we talked about um the challenge of um infrastructure and how um local developers are um accessing technology

and um that is one part of the challenge of democratizing AI. It's not only about uh data. It's not only about models. It's also about looking at the infrastructural component of this. Um we

talked about upstream contributions and um yeah ensuring that everyone who's using open source is contributing back to us as well. That's as I mentioned earlier also one of the key concerns of

the digital public goods alliance. So happy to explore this more how we can facilitate and motivate uh this kind of contributions. We talked about cars without seat belts and the needs uh that

these cars actually have seat belts and are shipped uh um in that state uh to the deployers. Um we also talked about the lack of understanding of open source AI and uh the need um that there is more

um yeah building of this understanding with policy makers and we also touched upon open source as an actual geopolitical strategy um for leaders which I think is in the Indian context

specifically interesting and and timely. Um coming back to um what Mrs. Kofler said earlier from Bangalore to Berlin we need this global collaboration to address any of these challenges all of

these challenges and to also move the needle from access to agency in technology development and um on this note I would like to end here. Thank you so much to all the speakers um to the

organizers of this panel discussion. It was a pleasure to moderate
