## 📝 Transcript

Yes. two or three days. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I see. I see. these people. [clears throat]

at the impact summit. It's great to see you all back again this morning. I'm Amanda Brock. I'm the CEO of Open UK and we're an industry organization for the business of open technology. We bring

the we convene we bring together the UK community and then we do work around legal and policy and open source in the UK. uh we've been working with the Indian open source community since last

summer trying to support their engagement with the impact summit and to bring some of that open source leadership to the summit this week. Um I've got a really interesting discussion

for you this morning on resilience and we have uh a very esteemed panel here today to talk to you about it. Our session's titled building resilience and breaking dependency in enterprise and

public sector AI. How can open source support this? And we we came to this point of talking about dependency and resilience because over the last year we've seen lots of conversations as

we've seen geopolitical shift in the world. We've seen lots of conversations about sovereignty and a lot of the time when people discuss sovereignty there's a disconnect. We mean different things

by it. It's not clear what we mean. Some people have talked about 2026 becoming the year of the ontology when we start to define what some of the terminology we're using means. Personally, I'm going

to set the scene by saying I don't like sovereignty. I don't like sovereignty because I'm a globalist and a member of the open source community. And we've achieved what we've achieved by working

across geopolitical boundaries, by working across borders and collaboratively creating the world's best software. In my opinion, um I think really what we're concerned about is not

where the software comes from, not where the AI comes from, not about who really creates it, but about dependency. And we have this challenge of being dependent on companies from other

nations. And that's an obvious challenge that everybody acknowledges. And what we need to think about is, you know, what are the real concerns here? Is it that we have something from another nation?

Is it this dependency? Is it risk? What is the concern? So, in this panel today, we're going to get into some of this discussion. And um from, you know, from my perspective, I'll set the scene, and

the panelists may well not agree with me. From my perspective, what we really care about is making sure that we can have access to the technologies we're using in our nation states, whether

that's in the public sector or in enterprise. And for me, to do that, you open the technologies up. So let's see what the panelists think about this. And as I said, we've got a very esteemed

panel today. We have Mishi Chre from Software Freedom Law Center. And Mishi was the founder of Software Freedom Law Center. We were at an event last night together where she said, "We've known

each other since 2008." She's uh very much an internationally recognized leader in open source and the legal aspects of open source. And we have Anastasia Stenko from uh

Pers, an AI company that's open um from Paris. Anastasia is a bit of a force to be reckoned with as you'll see as we we go through the conversation. Today we have Laura Gilbert who I know from

number 10 where she was working on AI for Richishy Sunnak's team and built the uh I think it's the digital incubator in number 10 before moving to Tony Blair Institute. And then last but not least,

we have a gentleman on our panel today. We have Jimmy Wales who you will undoubtedly know as the founder of Wikipedia. So coming to the panelists with the

first question. I think I'll start with Jimmy since he was the last person I mentioned. And my first question this morning is about dependency, resilience, and sovereignty. Now these are slightly

different things. Where do you sit in that? And how do we manage these? Hello. Um, yeah. So, you know, for me, one of the things that I'm super interested in and and do a lot of myself

uh is uh local large language models. Uh, so I bought the most expensive laptop that I've ever bought in my life, uh, with 128 gig of RAM and M4. And I'm very excited for the M5 to come out in

the next few days hopefully. Uh, and this is a this is a new development because for many years I was like most people I just I only need a laptop two generations old because I just get on

the internet. I'm not doing photo editing or anything like this. Suddenly I'm like, "Oh, actually this is really interesting and really important to have a really powerful processor because you

can run local models that are just maybe six months behind the leading edge proprietary models." And this is really exciting uh for a lot of different reasons and it does impact on all of

these things. Um you know we've talked for years and years and years in the open source uh free software world about uh vendor lock in and uh dependency and all of this. This is even more true uh

in the AI era. There's also all of the enormous privacy concerns around um you know both at a personal level uh you know people are using these things in ways that are pretty shocking what

people will tell to an AI bot that you would never ever consider telling uh some huge company right uh and for a lot of companies there's a lot of proprietary information sometimes there

are legal obligations around the data privacy so this idea of having uh a very open vibrant uh open- source community and people releasing uh models and new techniques and so on to reduce the

amount of processing power that has huge implications across um all kinds of things and and touches on for example uh sovereignty. So, you know, for governments wanting to use AI, they may

have a concern about using an AI that's controlled by one of sort of five or six huge companies. Um, and they may say, "No, actually, we we really want to be really careful about that and not be

locked into to one thing." So you know I think the encouragement of open uh actually open AI I don't mean to say open AI but the &gt;&gt; that's the problem [laughter]

&gt;&gt; but the encouragement of of you know open access to models uh is huge and obviously I come from the Wikipedia world and uh you know a lot of the uh things we're interested in have to do

with uh diversity of culture, diversity of language um and obviously the big commercial models. They're actually pretty good at a lot of that stuff because they're just devouring all of

the internet, but they aren't really focused on that. And I do think that that is something of of actually great importance that we'll see in the next few years.

&gt;&gt; And Laura, you know, you come from a public sector background, going back to that same question, dependency, resilience, and sovereignty being different things. Where where do you see

this all fitting together? I think like you, I sort of uh instinctively recoil away from the idea of sovereignty. I'm just not highly nationalistic. But um we are in a space where countries

I think more and more do need to think about um how they can have control over supply chains and and and be more resilient. And you know, as Jimmy sort of alluded to, there is an element to

which I think there is a real risk of loss of diversity if we are relying on only two superpowers to provide mostly commercial um models where you're going to get quite a high level of hetrogenity

and um sort of washed out of the system over time. If everybody around the world is using the same two types of model, um it's going to be impacting not just sort of the language but also the culture and

people's identification with their history and even on quite a small national level. You know, the idea of does the model that you're communicating with um sort of on a day-to-day basis

understand for for the Brits what tea means and how it can be supper as well as a drink. Um so it it feels very trivial on some regards but in other ways it's it's not because you can lose

your uh you can lose your control and resiliency directly by losing control of your supply chain by being very dependent on particular providers who can then cut you off or can be cut off

from you by changes in geopolitics. But you can also lose your independence and sovereignty subtly and quietly and without really noticing it. And I think that we need to be really worried about

that aspect as well. &gt;&gt; I I find that subtlety interesting. I've been around in tech a long time. I've done about 30 year in fact I've done exactly 30 years in the tech sector. And

uh I think what we see is that whole piece with uh evolution that's got us to this point unexpectedly of having those big techs. I don't think anybody would have allowed this to

happen if we'd had a crystal ball. Things would have been different. The difference is now we actually know how we got there and we have to work that out and where we're going. Mishi, can I

come to you with the same question? &gt;&gt; Sure. Um, so I was born in India. I aged in the US. I'm not sure how I feel about nationalism or uh but I do think that sovereignity doesn't mean solitude.

You don't have to uh operate by yourself. You can build in collaboration in communities. I um am uh the general counsel for a DCbased cyber security company. And when we are

selling software, it doesn't matter who's buying. And as a lawyer who's served many of the communities for whether it's the kernel or Apache or Debian, uh I have seen what

collaboration across borders brings and that also means that the boogeyman which is China, oh China should not do it first. They have also contributed a lot to making robust systems and that only

open source made it possible. I do also think that this is the Indian moment because the hyperscalers are showing us one way of doing it and that is also the elimination of labor

and the Chinese understand that the smaller models inferences running on smaller devices on low power in every device is how they will do manufacturing but they also manufacture political

desperatism. But we are here here where enablement of minds which is what open source does. It has helped us become the people who build things whose minds are enabled

because they give us the ability to solve problems together. This is why um we need software tools that are making farmers and artisans more productive, helping students learn, helping doctors

take care. And I and I do think that part of sovereignity means that your culture, your representation is not eliminated. You make these tools in your color. I I don't lose my Indianness when

I hyphenate it with my Americanness. I want all of those parts of mine to be existing. And similarly when I think of these things as systems not just systems of code and data but systems of code

data and human experience human beings doing things in the market in the government in the society in the school that's when I think about these tools whatever we are calling them today

machine learning on steroids large language models you're calling them whatever it is the most important thing is is that people have to make decisions and whether those are individuals who

are developers or kinds of people who are users. Um in computer programming world these days we do not know if it's a people or a machine or who's they're not distinct. We we want us to be you to

actually grow up understanding that our minds are ours and uh we make choices and how our minds are used are our choices and that's how I see sovereignity and enabling and

using these tools to build for ourselves and that's why I don't feel it is um solitude. It is not about cutting yourself or protectionism. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And you bring up a really

interesting question there about China. And I think one of the very notable things about China is the scale of their contribution to open source and the shift in their policy. So that just

hasn't happened overnight. China in 2017 shifted to an open-source policy and has not only shifted to a policy but has built the necessary pieces in the landscape from the open atom Foundation

to hold code all the way across that landscape. And they they just issued their next five-year plan at the end of October. And in that plan, they're talking about how they continue with

open source and build, you know, from the the the position they're in for an economically successful future. And I think we have a lot to learn from how they've done that and I think that's

enabled a lot of their resilience. Um I'm going to come with the same question. Anastasia, you've got a very different perspective I imagine.

&gt;&gt; Yes. Quite a different perspective from a person who was born in Russia, a champion of sovereignty which and digital sovereignty actually which completely annihilated the individual

freedom. Um and as also a CEO and co-founder of a company which uh does create uh very small language models among the best uh fully in open source meaning that all not only the weights

and the code is open but the data the training data which is actually the most important aspect of the systems is open as well and I do want to add two words which are important to me to the

discussion. one is empowerment and another one is competitiveness and competitiveness here uh when we're talking about the opensource AI for enterprise is a very important aspect

and something on which we can actually build more resilient business models for open-source AI because um the current systems such as uh cloud code cloex uh all of all of these things they

obviously offer already huge gains in productivity for the enterprises. However, the fear that I'm seeing um in the corporate circles uh as well as for some more forward thinking uh

technologists is that we are losing competitiveness by introducing the same exact tools which actually completely get out all of our data which is very specific to some of the business

processes that we implement these tools for. and we actually lose competitiveness towards the uh other companies in the same sector as well. Um we saw how the application layer of the

II revolution of the latest revolution was one of the most funded and kind of the biggest one. Everybody was like okay let's build a cursor for X. Let's build a cursor. Okay. And all of those rappers

actually now being directly competitive uh being in direct competition with those companies on which they relied on for their models because if you actually push this all of this kind of further

you see that the actual AI product is the model. uh the hardness is important, the systems around are important but the main capabilities are being developed inside of the models and specifically

during this agantic turn which has been fully assumed fully developed by the leading companies such as Google, OpenAI and of course anthropic. So I I I think that here the point is uh is that what

we really need to think about is competitiveness and competitiveness can come in different ways. It's not only about doing the best model. It's actually doing the best model for and

two and four could be domain ad domain adaptation but it means building sometimes from scratch. Yes, sometimes you do need to protrain for specific industries. I'm sorry to say this, not

everything is solvable through uh a llama or quen fine-tuning. Um unfortunately um sometimes it means uh adapting sometimes it's creating uh creating some uh more more complex

harnesses and systems. Yes. Um and uh the point the point here is that sometimes it's also about resilience in terms of hardware how you can actually deploy those models. For example, the

niche and what we built for is actually this very edge environments. our models run on eight gig uh computers. So [laughter] I mean this because like eight gig is nothing like compar

compared to like basically uh what already uh max allow. But when you want to run a model on Android uh and you want to to be this to be offline, this is the kind of models you

need which are super small and don't require lots of memory. And this is also the case um this will be the case. You will need to have very very small models uh when we actually pass at scale uh and

when the processes are automated just because of the sheer scale of the data we need to process etc. And to finish with the empowerment um the monolytic models and the

legalistic situation where you have a couple of companies all training on kind of the same data most of the most of which has been kind of stolen. Um uh it's well I mean they already admitted

it, right? So uh uh that's that's kind of also the point. If we if we want individuals to be truly empowered and to actually build what they want to build through the lens which is theirs, we

need to create more uh capacities and opportunities for decentralized TI development to give the communities and even further on the road the individuals to power to develop their models. Why?

Because those models are actually becoming the interface through which we interact with the digital world and with the web as well. &gt;&gt; So I like this concept of empowerment

and competition. And when Prime Minister Modi opened up the summit in Paris that you and I were at, he said access for all. And access for all for me means those two things. I don't use the same

words as Anastasia, but I think about the ability of every person to access the technology for their benefits as tools and then I think about innovators building and iterating on top of what's

already there and creating competition. So I I really like the way you summed that up. Just before I move on to the next question, Jimmy, you smiled when she mentioned data. Do you want a minute

just to say something on the data before I move to the next question? &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; or we can wait till later. No, it's fine. Yeah. No, so um all of the uh

large language models are very heavily trained on Wikipedia and broadly that's a good thing. Um I always say you know you wouldn't really want to use an AI trained only on X. It would be very

angry and uh would only fight with you. Um at the same time uh all of our work uh you know the the you know if we talk about access for all the original vision for Wikipedia is for all of us to

imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. So that is really fundamental to everything that we do. So it's our

gift to the world and we're happy that it's being used. Um at the same time uh we are uh having some good success uh in uh persuading the large uh AI companies to work with us um with our enterprise

product. Um you know they've been hammering our servers uh which is expensive to us and I only recently came to fully understand why. I was like well how many can there be? How many bots?

Well, when humans come to Wikipedia, they tend to come like the the largest traffic is the huge spike. So, when the queen died, you know, millions of people came to Wikipedia to read the one page,

which means it was cached in RAM. We just send it out to millions of people. It doesn't cost very much. When an AI bot crawls us, uh, they hit every obscure page and we need more database

servers, more everything. So, the cost is disproportionate. And the average donation to Wikipedia is, uh, just around $10. And those people are not giving to subsidize uh huge AI

companies. They are giving to support our community and the efforts that we're making. Um and those arguments do carry the day like uh we've had a lot of success with a lot of the players.

Google was the first you know big anchor customer to say look you know like it is our gift to the world but you should pay if you're using a disproportionate amount you know chip in. Uh so that's

really important to us. They are very different from a lot of publishers because a lot of publishers are trying to um uh you know they're worried about copyright and they're worried about you

know is this stealing our content and so on and so forth. I'm I'm very cautious in that area because we know that um you know the there is a certain kind of overreach that is very common uh with

copyright and efforts to say oh no I have copyright you're not allowed to do anything with that which means impacts fair use and impacts scientific research and sharing knowledge and so on and so

forth. So I'm a little cautious about that but we're very different like we're just like well it is free. Yeah. Yeah. You can take it. Just please don't smash our servers. That's not free. So yeah,

&gt;&gt; and I I like when you talk about a gift to the world because this is what open source oops just got bit of furniture moving going on. Um uh open source is very much our

gift to the world and one of the the challenges we have is how that's funded and these shifts in ecosystem that move the balance of power and see companies making money out of the environments

that we've created as that gift. And obviously the licensing as Jimmy says the copyright piece you know we're quite liberal in our copyright but there has to be some payback into that ecosystem

conversation I think probably for another day. I want to go back to this conversation about resilience and think there's there's going to be a lot of conversation I imagine this week

particularly tomorrow in the leaders day around local models and I'm going to ask the panel where those local models fit if they think they're important and if they are important why are they

important and Mishi if you're okay I'm going to come to you first on this because India's had a lot of talk about local models Yeah, I I do think that

on &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think now it's on. &gt;&gt; Um, so I think one of the interesting things about building these ecosystems is we did hack copyright law to then

serve all everybody. And uh and that hacking worked because at least there was an agreement about certain rules that worked all around. Now there is an agreement that pilfering

is fine if you're a large big hyperscaler and you're very rich and then your CEO can come and announce well maybe we should rethink copyright now. So that does have an impact on how the

communities maintain. I used to be open SSL's lawyer. The first time they approached me I thought of that IKCD cartoon. They were literally three people and I I had to really ask them

are you just three people and this is open SSL and this is the entire internet. Um and and we didn't have resources but were so important for a FIPS 140-2 module because that's what

the US federal government needed that we had to get them to some level to get resources in it. So I I am very very sensitive to the idea that that freedom is created by a lot of communities that

work together that those bots which are coming to Wikipedia are not looking at Jimmy's face for donation all the time and they're not looking at the ads. So nobody's looking at ads and that

generation of revenues being created to maintain those communities. Nobody's donating there and and that and those people are not going to maintain these pages and have those Wikipedia editing

fights with everybody which makes it such a robust system &gt;&gt; and can we come back to models though? No, but that's why I'm saying when I when we talk about local models here in

especially when you're talking about here, I don't think we need frontier models for everybody. every country doesn't have to get into the same game and that's why the commoditization of

certain underlying bases is so important and that's why from our conversation the standards h are important whether it is the N2CP protocol or certain other places where uh we are whether it's

goose or something else where we are all building things together then it helps but the smaller models like Anastasia was saying like I'm a lawyer I don't want to use um cloth's legal plug-in

because I don't want that. So we will have something which is tailored to a certain specific thing in India. We are now doing a public consultation of a data sets license where our own data

sets are going to be used as the training models for smaller things. This is what we are talking about. Uh you were talking about tea and we can have that debate of course which tea is

better. I do think Indian one wins but uh but I do think that it's an important subtlety to say that local needs whether it is about language or it is about just the requirement is something which is

going to give us those smaller models smaller inferences for sure and the and and the investments that's why have to be in basic infrastructure of compute and open standards so that people can

adapt and build a much smaller smaller one and not the large investments. Tomorrow, of course, as you rightly said, the discussion is going to be mixed about large investments in data

centers and then how those models are going to get trained. But we will see the more uh open standards are built in, the more things get commoditized, the smaller the requirements and tailored

for specific needs is what is going to proliferate. And I I I totally agree with you and I think there's often a mix a missed piece in the conversation where people don't understand open source who

are engaging with it. And it's that commoditization and how that actually happens. And it doesn't happen by telling people this is going to be how it works. It happens by

the open communities choosing to adopt and they choose to adopt what works for them. So you have to build that engagement with them to get what works for them. And I think that's really

missing in a lot of what I'm seeing on the local level. An Estasia, I'm going to come to you with that same question about local models. Are they important? &gt;&gt; 100%. And I think that uh one of the

main points was it the same for me about the copyright and about why we need more decentralized uh AI. It's actually about the share and the the share of power which comes from AI. It's not about the

fact that no uh you you shouldn't you shouldn't build something that will empower the humanity. Uh you shouldn't develop artificial intelligence because there is copyright or you shouldn't

build something because um because other like a specific other nation should be able to do to build the same. It's not about this but uh it's about the fact that if we do not act now in terms of

decentralization and I'll explain what it would actually mean for AI development we will we might finish in the society where the only political power in the in the situation where

labor has been significantly changed uh the only political power will be with those who own GPUs for data centers. filled with geniuses. I'm quoting Dario, CEO of Entropic here. No,

but that's that's that's a real that's a real question because uh for there is a difference between uh the previous situation with open source and the current situation because for AI models

to run whether they are open source or not you need the physical reality of the energy and the GPU. So this changes everything because now we can have open-source models. They can be amazing

if we do not have the compute enough to run those models. They don't serve anything and it's really important point. So when I'm when we are talking about local models, I am not seeing the

other way to to at this point of how we can actually build more decentralized DI how we can share the value created from the EI revolution in better more equitable ways than doing very small

because okay there is compute uh let's think about another shortage which some of you probably some of you are gamers and You already know that it's almost impossible now to build your own PC

because the memory is so expensive. Okay. So there is memory, there is compute and u the only way is to miniaturaturize to go to go down so that the local models can empower not only

nations but the communities the enterprises as well uh in order to get to claim actually their uh their the the value that this um the CI revolution can produce. So, and I I really want to uh

tell you a small anecdote uh which kind of will explain why I'm so obsessed with this. Um two years ago, uh players was at the beginning of um the first uh sovereign AI uh co-pilot of the French

government. Okay. So, we started working with the government and they wanted this to be based on open source quite immediately. It was the time when Falcon and Lamachu first came out this the

first open-source uh models with commercial licenses and they wanted you know in France there is this idea of equity so that basically if a public servant gets something to um improve

right its work another public servant should kind of also get it right so you cannot just empower one public servant and forget another one so the beginning of the project okay it's a proof of

concept it should serve 15,000 people and everything we we we got in terms of the GPUs were four GPUs. So we were like cool yeah let's go like back in the days like all of these

models were even very bad in French to be fair right like so like and we started doing the 7B models because this was the only way we could actually serve. So this was the pork how many

actually public servants are there in France? Six million. &gt;&gt; Wow. How are we going to serve? No, but like for real like because it's it's it's interesting to talk about like okay

yes we can have uh cloth code we can have like lucha by mist whatever but the actual costs and the actual value generated like let's just compare those things. So this is why if we are real

believers in the AI revolution like this will be the industrial revolution we need to think of local models right away. So I think that's a super interesting

answer and it's slightly sidetracking but data centers have come up twice now. We have somebody from NScale in the room who are working in the UK in this space and I was in China in Beijing in

December with the open source community there and they were talking about compute and what I learned is that Chinese AI engineers are obsessed with building lean small technology because

they don't have the same access to compute. And the more I listen the more I'm hearing that this is where we're driving. And I do wonder about these giant data centers we're building that

are costing so much money, requiring so much energy, and potentially so unfriendly to our environment. You know, when we think about people, power, planet, the the three chakras of this

summit, whether those are where we should be driving, but I'm I'm sidetracking the conversation slightly. I want to come to Laura who has worked in the UK and the public sector.

Small and not small models. I am slightly obsessed with small models. Sorry. Sovereign models. What do you think? &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, you you come back to the

original define sovereignty. Um I you know, local and specific models are really going to underpin our ability to operate going forward. It's you I was interested in your point on competition

actually and I this is a bit of a segue, but I promise I'll bring it back around. Um competition itself is very different than it used to be in the tech space. you the AI value chain is so complex

that we're no longer in a space where it's a zero- sum game and this one company can provide you know one type of product and service out compete another one and win. You're very much in a space

where what you're seeing commercially is that the companies that succeed uh tend to be forming really strong partnerships and they tend to be able to pick up and flip out members of that partnership to

meet specific needs, you know, worldwide. And we need a very similar approach when it comes to the public sector where you can flip out your models. And this is for me a lot of the

power of the open-source uh sort of community's impact on the public sector. Um it obviously opens up new opportunities, but it also creates a new sort of ecosystem.

So my my the thing I care about most is reducing inequality. uh and much like you know with the sort of AI uh solutions in the tech space um

where we're in a world where it's not zero sum where the right collaborations can drive much greater overall sized pies for everyone to sort of you know go and and and benefit from in the public

sector. the more open source solutions we get out and the more you can flip in a different model to meet your local needs but still you know produce something um we we have the real

opportunity to reduce that global inequality and become just a across the world safer uh you know with better health outcomes better educational outcomes um you know a basic minimum

standard for everybody that rises up um and in creating these sort of open source collaborations you you obviously break a lot of the grip of certain nations on certain parts of the supply

chain um but you also enable the spinning up of new sorts of companies and what we see in the government space is that when you have really good open source solutions and what I did in the

British government was create a lot of those and you know they get picked up worldwide you put in a new local model that's relevant to your context but you also drive the creation of a lot of

small companies in that local region who can spin that up and deliver that solution into the public sector really quickly and it's a different kind of company, a different kind of

collaboration. It potentially even gives you uh a little bit of the answer to what do you do when a lot of people lose their jobs through certain types of AI adoption. Will you create a new ecos

ecosystem that enables better delivery of public sector? More companies doing things more efficiently in more local spaces and meeting the local user needs and enabling us to get to that point

where the kind of uh governments that couldn't afford to pick up this kind of technology and couldn't afford to serve their public the way we'd like to can can suddenly get involved in this space

and drive their own ecosystems. I think it's just think it's hugely powerful and local models really need to underpin that. &gt;&gt; Thank you Laura. You you almost said a

phrase that we use as a bit of a cliche in open source which is a rising tide lifts all boats and I really think that's what we're achieving with this. Um, I don't always agree with the UK in

terms of our policies and our legislation, but I very much do agree with our road map. And our road map said that in terms of sovereignty, the UK would not be isolationist. We recognized

our collaboration partners. And in fact, when it comes to open source, the UK is India's second biggest collaborator despite our relatively dimminionive size and you're a huge open source community.

So Jimmy, can I come to you with the same question? Local models, sovereign models. What do you think? &gt;&gt; I mean, I think I I did already cover that pretty well. I mean, I think that

it's really important uh that we see the growth of uh and the support for local models because of all the reasons that we've talked about. So I'm not sure I have much to add.

&gt;&gt; Okay. So I'll stay with you then for the the third question that we've got. We've seen a huge amount of geopolitical shift in the last year and I'm probably more sensitive to it than most people because

the UK used to be part of the EU. We Brexited six years ago and a lot of our collaboration has become very difficult because of that with the EU. It's getting better, but there was a reaction

to that shift and I can pinpoint it to a second in time when it happened. Over the last year, there's been so much conversation about geopolitics. How do we surmount that? How do we create an

environment where we're able to continue to collaborate cross border despite all the things happening across the planet? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, you know what's interesting is um like the the world of

what goes on in politics and the different you know very difficult times when I look at the Wikipedia community right people mostly don't pay much attention to all that. I mean thank

goodness right uh with all the culture wars and the and the creation of anger between different groups of people what we still see is fantastic friendships across borders friendships across very

difficult borders uh sometimes there's a few quarrels around things that have happened and so forth and people emotions can be quite high but broadly I think the same thing is generally true

across uh technology uh you know open source communities uh they have their I mean like us they have their own internal dramas that are probably more dominant [laughter]

than uh which country you're from. It's sort of like which you know which code editor are you using? That's a religious war right there. And uh so you know I I remain very very optimistic about human

beings. You know people do really do get like we are all humans. We are all here on this planet. We have the opportunity to do amazing exciting fun things together. And yeah, you know, there's

people out there who are generating anger and discord, and I don't think the social media algorithms are helping. They're actually hurting in all of that. Um, and so, you know, I I just think we

we all need to sort of stick to those values of saying like, you know, like we're all here. Let's let's make amazing things together. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. I'm going to come

to Anastasia who probably has two perspectives. one living in France and one as France is part of the EU and from an outsider's perspective looking in on the EU they are very very nationalistic

at the moment about sovereignty they recognize that you can't build sovereignly whether it's software or AI without using open source because you need that as your cornerstone

but I always feel quite concerned about this attitude that is going to try and localize open source so I'd be really interested in where you're seeing that and you know your your thoughts on it.

&gt;&gt; Oh 100%. Uh 100% and there are some countries which are already more nationalistic than others. One the one which is trying to put the label the the the original

label on its uh on its own tag is France because uh we are supposed to be parts of the French t which I'm always a bit cringed about. I'm sorry to say this word but I uh specifically when what is

trying to be promoted is open source open source for me is by definition something that uh requires the collaboration of individuals and this is actually how it has always been built

very um let's say opinionated individuals either contributing to the Wikipdia community to the larger uh to the larger opensource community including software. So uh uh I'm I'm

definitely seeing this and it does really uh scare me. Why? because I have already seen this play out in Russia [laughter] and uh uh uh it has finished as being extremely isol isolationist

uh and very under undermining both for uh the local the local communities as well as their inclusion in the broader uh global uh opensource and tech community in general. So for me this is

uh this is not the path and I do uh this and I do totally agree with the fact that we should double down on the open source and not on uh the uh sovereign un sovereign usage weaponization of open

source. Um then uh once again for us for example as a company based in France we have more ties more collaborations with the organizations with the companies with the communities based outside of

France or even outside of the European Union. This is very paradoxical because I mean it makes kind of sense to work uh locally, right? We were talking about local models and some of the

collaboration should be local but it just happens out to be so that we connected much more and created many more collaborations and things uh with the people uh who have reached out to us

on Twitter unfortunately once again there is this uh or with the community specifically Wikipdians we are very close uh to that community or mazilians and etc etc. So the point for me is that

uh we really should focus not on the uh flavor of the open source uh but actually on the open source itself and what creates its nature. when I'm talking about flavor, I'm not I don't

think that we need to be concentrated on that it is French or German or uh British open source uh because this kind of for me this undermines the very definition and it undermines what the

outputs that it actually gives because for example the European Union has kind of heavily funded um some of the AI opensource developments and I must say that due to the fact that it was always

presented not as open source and putting up front not not not present as open but not putting up front some of the benefits for the open source community you know because like when for example

Chinese models come out they really put up front some of the architectural differences you know some of the things that open source enthusiasts can actually use you know even themselves

based on the papers when you see open-source EU projects it's all about yes we have done the most European model on Earth. &gt;&gt; Mhm.

&gt;&gt; Wow. Cool. And what about like people for example in India like one of the one of the regional communities that we for example exchange the most of with what about them like should they be concerned

by this or just like for me it's open source washing and this is what I hate the most to be fair and it's really interesting that it's a different kind of open washing that's just evolving. I

sometimes call it local source, not open source. And I had no idea that was going to be your answer. So I gave them the questions before and it's not what I expected. Sorry.

&gt;&gt; And I'll tell you why it's not what I expected. A very old friend of mine who I think is a hero of open source was with me two weeks ago in Brussels. And I said to him, "What have you done?"

And they're now building this sovereign stuff. I said, "What have you done? You've sold us down the river." And he said to me, "Amanda, sometimes you just take the money and do what you have to."

And I was so shocked. I really was because this is one of my heroes. You know they say never meet your hero. There you go. Laura, any thoughts, always. Um, yeah. I mean that so

the geopolitical angle is very interesting at the moment and of course you've seen some really major changes and and and the one that's impacted me has been the change in the position in

the American administration and um this struck me first sort of straight in the face a couple of years ago I was in Canada speaking at the Vector Institute conference and it was the same day that

the the tariffs hit Canada. So had the privilege in very rare privilege in being in a room full of angry Canadians who you don't usually get unless it's ice hockey. They're all

&gt;&gt; that's not really their style, is it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter] Um and so sort of across Canada, people were were pulling American products off the shelves and you know they're very very upset and

very angry. And I was also upset um not so much about the tariffs because you know not my circus at this point but um I was upset about the changing positioning because what we were hearing

out of the US and it reflected very quickly although at a much smaller scale in the UK was uh we don't care about safety anymore we care about security safety includes aspects of diversity

inclusion fairness bias and security doesn't and in fact pressure on US companies actively and US organizations across the board to reject diversity and inclusion

uh and and this is now painted as a sort of bad thing and there's a number of reasons I'm really uncomfortable with that a lot of it is you know statistics and data and evidence-based you know a

quick example we've got some lovely studies that show if you have a more diverse group of people they make a better more successful decision 87% of the time so you know when you say no we

know it's fine if everybody's homogeneous you know that this is in some way a fair playing field. That that was kind of upsetting, but that's a little bit of a segue. Um but also the

fact that as I was speaking to this conference which is full of a lot of people who are in the open source space um they've a lot of people have made a career and feel very passionate about

the idea that technology should be an enabler and it should be fair and it should be something that everybody can access. And so hearing a political message that goes very much the other

way and the instant response from particularly you know the leadership of a lot of US tech companies that went great we're going to go all in for this much less fair and equitable technology

solution was really upsetting and the other thing I noticed as I look around the room is I thought to myself hang on a minute who's building the technology it's not the it's not the politicians

but it's us we're all sitting here building the technology we have actually the power to reject this as a premise. We have the power to say, "Well, I I hear that you're saying you don't care

about bias, but we still do, and we're going to build it that way." And that is difficult in closed environments with very lucrative tech companies. But actually, the people that control those

tech companies more than they realize are the staff. And we can insist on building in the way we think is right. And when we do it in the open and as a group and as a worldwide group of

technologists uh not only you know can you build the kind of technology they think the world should have but you can also prove that you've done it and you can check that other people

are doing it. So for me the actually a lot of the answer to a geopolitical environment that I personally find challenging and in some senses threatening is for all of us to engage

in this sort of work and as a group of humans and technologists agree on what we think the standards are and insist that that's how we build. I I think that's super interesting and I don't

know whether you know but the Python Foundation run by Deb Nicholson turned down a million dollars of funding when it came to renew it because they wouldn't sign uh the documentation that

they were required to by parts of the US government and a very bold decision to do that. That's my timer we're going off. We've only got a few minutes left. Um Mishi, I'm going to come to you and

then I'm going to very quickly run round the panelists for a final word. So Mishi, geopolitics. Well, um, as as much as I love the community and I would want and I totally

agree with Laura, that's where our energies should be going because despite the differences, um, and as Amanda said, it was in 2011 when Huawei showed us the road map of going towards open-source. I

was in their IP conference room. These lawyers came up and told us how they were going to move everything there. And then there was of course the US um Bureau of Industry Standards saying we

can't have we have to put Huawei on entity list but it still continues to operate and play in those spaces. So that does happen but I think we would be fooling ourselves if we thought that uh

we live in 2010 and the bulcanization of internet is not going to happen and the Facebooks and the Googles etc going to bring democracy and everybody's going to be able to connect with the world. It is

very true that priorities of nations are very different. I also we've also seen what has happened at the Munich conference. We know what is happening in my one home and we are also seeing where

the rest of the world in global majority is looking towards India for that leadership. What we decide is also going to be how Africa 55 countries think about it. So the US hyperscalers are

very much right now very luxuriously funded by telling us that artificial general intelligence is just around the corner. that and and what they're tr trying trying to do is buying trillions

of borrowed money and eliminating labor forever. It is geopolitics. They are going to go in that direction and they are going to try to jin up public fury to say, "Oh, the Chinese shouldn't get

there. That's why fund us more." And that's going to happen. It's there's no denying there. And then these large companies with the kind of revenue models that they have and the monies

they power they make they are part of industrial policy of a government. That is why trade agreements competition law works in this way. This is an AI impact summit. It is impacting us. We are

impacting it. We want everybody to play together. That's why we are talking about open. But that doesn't mean those two parallel things will not happen. India will be told you can't buy

Russia's oil you have to do these tariffs so India will make its own choices and similarly will other countries EU is making those choices we don't want these labels and open source

allows us that's why the commoditization as we were talking about of tools and India wants to export its brains its services building on things which the entire world can use so that will all

exist simult simultaneously there is a different internet in India there is half the thing the Netflix you watch here is not the Netflix one watches in other parts that's true and

these tools similarly when the first Gemini model it wasn't called Gemini that time the first advisory on AI told you cannot ask certain questions to that model in India so it will look a little

different and I think we'll be ignoring the realities in front of us if we said geopolitics will not impact how technology will be built. &gt;&gt; So we're we're technically out of time

and I'm going to ask each panelist to give me one sentence that they would see as a takeaway from this discussion for the room. And in doing that I'm going to say that I think we've seen in this

discussion something that's very important. I mentioned at the beginning an ontology, a year of ontology for AI. And we're seeing terms like civic tech, public good, digital public good being

used. And they're great terms and they're well-meaning. But I think there's a real concern about what's really sitting underneath those and whether that's becoming a way of open

washing rather than meeting the standards of open source. And I hear that coming out of this discussion. So Jimmy, I'm going to come to you first. Just one sentence for the room to take

away with them. Um, you know, we've had a lot of talk here about um, uh, diversity local. Uh, I just want to say I'm really happy to come to an AI tech conference and be on

a panel with all women, &gt;&gt; which is quite rare. &gt;&gt; Mishi, do you want to give us a final sentence? And thank you, Jimmy. &gt;&gt; Well, this is all thanks to Amanda. Um I

I do want to say uh if we do remember that people are at the center of all technology, everything else can guide us to decide the architectural cho choices of technology.

&gt;&gt; Laura, this very interesting I Amanda I'm so j like we know each other quite well and I think Amanda would tell you my energy level is at a different different place

than it usually is. Um I I I found this quite inspiring. However, uh it's it's a real privilege to sit on a panel with with Jimmy who I think has led led the world in jointly owned, jointly

generated intellectual property. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; And I think carrying the spirit of that forward uh within the tech community is is something that we couldn't possibly

go wrong with. And uh quick round of applause for Jimmy and a um a very last word of our panel because I know people want us out of the room.

Anastasia, I'm going to give you the last word. Never stop building. &gt;&gt; Thank you everyone. [applause]
