## 📝 Summary

Amid rising energy demands from AI data centers, renewables, and electrification, utilities and energy firms grapple with grid stability, predictive maintenance, and subsurface uncertainties. This NVIDIA speaker session unveils accelerated AI platforms - like Jetson for edge AI, Omniverse digital twins, and Grace Hopper Superchips - that revolutionize power utilities and upstream exploration. Key highlights include generative AI for real-time grid management, EV integration, and battery optimization, alongside subsurface breakthroughs: NVIDIA-powered seismic processing for fault detection in 3D models, physics-informed neural networks (PhysicsNeMo) for reservoir simulations, NLP/LLMs integrating well logs/seismic data with partners like Shell and Saudi Aramco, and high-performance imaging via collaborations with SLB and Shearwater for CO2 storage and production forecasting. Attendees will explore the latest strides NVIDIA is making to improve energy efficiency (tokens per watt per dollar), accelerate simulations, reduce emissions, and optimize workflows from exploration to delivery - enabling a more resilient, low-carbon energy ecosystem.
