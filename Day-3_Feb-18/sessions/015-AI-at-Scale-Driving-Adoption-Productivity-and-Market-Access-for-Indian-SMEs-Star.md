## 📝 Transcript

[music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Okay, good morning. Good morning. Thanks to all of you [music] for being here. Uh

it gives us some motivation to ensure that this talk is not just between us but [music] with all of you as well. Uh I know this is a first session after probably four weeks and probably out of

the main video. [music] uh but an important topic. So so chartered was supposed to be the moderator uh he had [music] to skip out today and and then I have to fill it up. Uh so [music] bear

with me if I'm unprepared but I do have some notes to refer and then I know each one of them. So we'll have a discussion and involve you as well as we move forward. Right. So so today's session uh

what we have titled uh is through the ISA. ISA is India Electronics and Semiconductor Association. uh it's the voice of the industry, government and academia together to ensure that this

semiconductor is moving forward in the country whether it's policies, talent, the ecosystem creation, the membership needs, uh the government initiatives, uh the academia focus and all of that comes

together at this platform called ISA and and then we ensure that uh we represent ourself in the events but also take back the learnings and the outcomes as form of initiative. ives and drive those

forward uh from these sessions onwards. Uh the topic that was suggested was AI for scale driving adoption, productivity and market access uh for Indian MSME and startups. Uh from the last two days at

least uh I have been part of the event here. I've been saying that there's a lot of discussion on saying like you know AI scale uh specifically and and deployment uh that's what we have been

because for few years we have been talking about the models the data the compute and all of that uh but we started looking at that how do we move from the prototype or benchmark into

pilots into actual deployment and use case and especially if you look at into the India ecosystem how do we leverage for the startups and MSMES is so that it helps them to proliferate as well as

create efficiency, do more automation and maybe take to the scale. So, so that's the topic that we have. Uh I have four distinguished speakers along with me. Uh here we'll do a quick round of

introduction and then we have some questions and then we'll come back to you as well. I'll start with me. Uh my name is Naven. Uh I work for Marvel Semiconductor. I'm also the vice

chairperson for ISA uh based out of Bangalore primarily focused on fabulous ship design uh working on data centers AI networking and enterprise silicon uh and and happy to be here. Uh Anand could

you just introduce briefly about what you do and and then how do you connect with this topic? &gt;&gt; Uh good morning everyone. Uh glad a few of you could make it uh today. Uh

my name is Anand. I head applied ventures. Applied ventures is the corporate venture arm of applied materials. Um we are one of the largest uh semiconductor and display equipment

uh maker in the world. Uh roughly around 250 to 300 billion market cap uh company. We have been investing uh globally in the deep tech sector for the last 20 years. U that's the only thing

we have been investing in. We don't invest in food delivery apps or dating websites. We have been uh hardcore focused around semiconductor, deep tech, materials uh science, physics, chemistry

uh related uh topics. Um we are pretty driven towards the the the topic is pretty uh important for us because we are working on the whole how do we bring AI what does AI mean from a startup

perspective and smallmedium businesses how does it affect it and the second uh part of it is how do you enable the AI at scale u which is uh the topic for today so looking forward to the

discussion with the est team team here &gt;&gt; thank you sep &gt;&gt; hello everyone my name is sep gupta I'm uh part of just like Naven I'm his colleague at IESA which is India

electronics and semiconductor association. Uh I'm also the VP central R&amp;D team um at Alpha Wave and managing director of Alpha Wave but now we're part of Qualcomm. Um I've been in the

tech industry for or rather the semiconductor industry for the last 27 years uh working on various things but now building chips for AI. Uh so we and just like Naven we are the ones who are

enabling all the AI ecosystem around the world. Uh on this particular topic uh I should um confess that I'm not an expert especially on the manufacturing side but yes my friends um do have uh industries

and I've talked to them a lot about this and so I do have some perspective uh on how AI can be adopted. Um my bottom line is it is imperative uh that we have to adopt AI even in the manufacturing

sector at a large scale. Um and we'll talk more about it as we go along. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Sure. Yeah. Yeah. This is Jodi Sundrai. I am the CEO and co-founder of Net Semi

Private Limited. This is a fabulous semiconductor company based out of Revander. We build a EDJI chipset primarily targeting ondevice and onremise computing EDJI

and uh we are actually building uh surveillance uh chips as well as uh AI MCUs uh targeting activities like surveillance, robotics, drones and all. This topic is extremely dear to us

because our focus is bringing uh AI onto edge uh making it private uh like data uh uh data security and all those things are being addressed in our designs. So and uh also uh making sure that it's not

uh a cloudcentric rather than uh it could be a devicecentric and uh premisecentric is our approach. uh we'll get into that more details in the in the session. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Pri good morning. My name is Pri Yadav. I work for NXP Semiconductors. I'm based out of Delhi and Sier. Glad to be part of this uh panel today and uh you know thanks to uh

the dear colleagues here. Uh why AI is important to us. I'm head for uh NXP India innovation ecosystem and when we talk about innovation I think AI is you know on the top of it. It's like you

know AI is like air. It's everywhere. Okay. So directly indirectly it is impacting each one of us as individual or you know as businesses. So as uh Jes mentioned that you know it's not only at

the cloud AI at the edge that's that's where you know NXP is uh really uh I would say driven about or serious about so we'll talk more during the uh panel today. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Sure. Thank you. So, so since this is an AI week uh uh and I was reading the paper today some statistics from times of India today morning right that the AI deployment uh that we are talking about

uh some of the statistics uh across men versus women uh it's it's much more deployed in men versus women almost a 10% 10 points difference in different professions uh even if we go into

different professions some of the professions where it's most deployed Obviously the software development engineering and some of the you know uh the content generation it's been pretty

heavily deployed almost like 70% of the people says that hey I'm using some form of AI to develop that and and do you know what's the least uh deployed one financial advisor

somewhere around 20%. and and then and another accountant an auditor again another 36% or something like that right so so there are mixed different things and again these are

just probably still a one set of jobs there are a lot of other jobs or roles or uh or things that people do uh across India and across the world and and then probably we'll get to know what's the

metrics for that as well the AI generated content in the world today is is supposed to be now 50/50 50% % of the contents lot of the journalism and other things is now 50% generated by AI and

50% is written by human so there's a lot of these started coming into us in first so-called as a use at scale right but if we have to go into our ecosystem and then since we talk about startups and so

I'll start with you Jotis first uh because you represent that right the can India AI story uh startup story be built around the three pillars that this uh this event has called planet progress

and people and and and then howmemesmemes can build that innovation and solutions around the India environment demography and the economic aspirations.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Navin. Uh this is extremely important topic. uh so uh to me uh AI is uh in the first phase of its journey right it's not the I think I would say probably it is first phase of

probably in the next four phases or five phases to come AI is now uh centered around cloud cloud the the the LLMs and the the models which are tuned for uh high cost and uh uh like energy uh

intensive deployments like uh server farms it is very easy uh if it is server farms you can actually put as much cost it's a centralized computer so you send all the data to the cloud and wait for

the results so which is a very good initiative I I'm pretty sure the world is benefiting from that but is that the way going forward so that is probably the first phase is excellent and the a

lot of generative a models are being generated People don't care about the compute and the optimization of it. But is that the Indian opportunity right? Indian opportunity I feel like is held

somewhere. Of course India can capitalize that opportunity as well in the form of service sector creating foundation models and all those things. But when you when it comes to pupil

planet and the progress probably the Indian opportunity is hi because when you come to the pupil problem then you are worried about privacy you are worried about uh the the type of uh data

which goes out and also you want immediate response. the new uh youth is extremely worried about environment, the cleanness and also the lot of other things which the the the AI can solve

which is not getting solved today. AI is right now being utilized primarily for a good search engine and an analytics tool but it can solve lot of problems like trash management. It can also be used

for activities like for example uh protecting um sec the security surveillance better surveillance without losing data to places which you don't want to send those data to. So these are

the opportunities out there when it comes to AI and uh we are not tapping it because we are focusing on the cloud. If you focus on domain specific optimization of AI in the form of

optimized uh devices optimized deployment if you focus that the India opportunities will come up that is what uh my point is here &gt;&gt; so so you have a chip out already jotis

right if you have to go like surveillance market do you have a percent is a single degree percentage use of some of these tools or intelligence that has come in or maybe

more proliferation &gt;&gt; even even in the surveillance world. uh so if you follow the the the the regular pattern like sending all the videos and all the things to the servers and cloud

and that's what happening today and the penalty is you are losing privacy people see look at this way AI is not the adapt the adoption of AI is very limited today primarily because people are worried

about data right and if if you approach if your approach is not sending everything send of course you Take benefit of cloud. Use the preliminary processing on the device on premise.

Make sure that no no unnecessary data goes out of your premise that the the the the adoption will go high and the opportunity for India this type of deployment ready platforms

are not yet there. It is a brand new domain. It is not a cloud which is already taken care by the big players. when it comes to domain specific huge amount of opportunities formemes and

startups and it's a big opportunity for &gt;&gt; so it is still very nent and &gt;&gt; it is extremely nent I would say even 5 percentage is captured &gt;&gt; okay fine yeah it's good to hear from

you before I come to the ecosystem player Anand uh you have a global view of of of how things are happening uh what can India startups or theme learn or adopt from the global AI uh and the

deep tech startups as well as the deployment that you have seen. Uh is there an examples from the world that you think can be leveraged or connected here?

&gt;&gt; I think maybe we start with the uncomfortable truth, right? I don't think there's any Indian deep tech company that is selling at a global scale today, right? Not in the

semiconductors, not in the uh not in the AI model side, right? We have lot of good examples on the software side etc. But there's no global deep tech company that is selling at scale. That's the

uncomfortable truth. It's it's not lack of talent. It's not lack of resources, not lack of venture capital uh at at this stage, right? There's enough money uh in India for everything,

right? What we need to think about is couple of things, right? One is this almost like a SAS like metrics applied to deep tech companies in India like everything has to be SAS like you know

can you sell in a year? Can you uh like know do pivot and do fast modeling fast right? Deep tech doesn't work that way. It takes like you know 9 12 18 months to to make a chip. It takes trust right you

can't do it in two days right but there's unnecessary expectations that u that is the case right we do need to have little we need to change our view around how we uh think about some of the

metrics to the deep tech sector right that's one the second thing is if you look globally right if u we have been investing uh globally for the last 20 years in deep tech right and and that's

why I keep to the AI and deep tech uh uh theme given uh the ISA uh thought process here right is there is less thought around when will I sell this company when will I go IPO

kind of a mindset on the deep tech right you have to go back and say am I solving a problem at scale that customers want to buy right and you also want to think about how do I deploy how do I integrate

it with the overall systems uh etc right that takes time effort right the algorithms and hardware and other things are 20% of the thing right the the the hard part is the integration at at scale

and making it work at scale. um as well right um few uh lessons from our what we have seen uh right for example we have a joint fund uh with Korea we have joint fund with Taiwan Korea is leading in the

whole memory display side and Taiwan obviously on the semiconductor side right is definitely there's a long push towards uh having a sustainable differentiation that works over a long

period of time right building a strong IP stack u goes a a long way the second things at least we see from other this one is they are very well integrated into what the high value problems are.

what are the big problems that need to be solved right and not at this moment right they know about what the high value problems are to be solved five years from now right so like if you see

lot of photonix companies like you know they started with saying is hey data is going to be a bottleneck five years from now right so that was a thesis we had uh so we ended up investing in few

companies in IR labs etc right but they have been working on it five few years right if you see the gros of the world a big 20 billion acquisition but they started working on it five 10 years ago

We didn't start uh uh uh today, right? So, you have to see what are some big problems that need to be solved in or where the bottlenecks are going to be in the next 5 10 years and and start

building on it because deep tech is going to take time but the payoffs definitely are there and obviously my colleagues here are represent some of the companies that have built that scale

and worth emulating as well. &gt;&gt; Sure. So I think the problem space is still not clearly defined for many of these right uh that you're highlighting. Uh quick 10-second answer do you have

any so-called as a promising who is I mean I don't need the name but but number one two three companies that you see from India that already working with you or still no entry as of now.

&gt;&gt; Um no there is we are we have heavily invested in India and we're going to heavily invest in India. uh but I think the criteria is the same. So one of the companies that they are at the show

today is a company called VVDN. They have gone from significant scale uh like they clearly benefit for benefited from a lot of the uh the talent etc. they've gone from uh like you know the scale

like nobody's business right uh like know they're taking all the business around the long tail of customers and I think some of the players here also use them right they're a leader leading

provider in the whole EMS and design stack right but they are now also building servers etc so true let us get 10 second answer &gt;&gt; okay good thank you Anand uh so sep now

to build all of these you need uh what we say is that the compute uh for sure the infra the funding the the the paying customers and all of that. Uh how do you think what new

models whether it is shared infrastructure the industry platforms the the the the government uh backed demand aggregation or the grants incentives

how how can these unlock the market uh opportunities for these startups? So I think um when we think of AI we are all blinded by all the big names claude chat GPD and such uh and these are

generally LLMs and uh which can take text based inputs or uh images and or videos and give you an analysis. uh Claude of course the Claude co-work if you guys are following um

they came up with the agentic uh uh AI agents which are doing tremendous amount of work and uh just making life easy for everyone uh at workplace at regular corporate level workplaces um I think we

are not looking at um the manufacturing sector as much today where uh they can benefit tremendously. Uh I was just reading a report which said uh the manufacturing sector is going to the

AI deployment and the manufacturing sector is going to grow at 40% CAGGR um until 2030. So that's tremendous opportunity. Now how do we deploy that? How do we get the ind small scale

industries and the medium scale industries uh to adopt that? Um so of course we need startups in that area and I think the government has some decent schemes which are already there. Uh the

biggest barrier I think I would say one barrier which we all also have is AI right we don't know what all AI can do today and we are discovering every day. So imagine

a family-owned business which has been doing business in the traditional way. U suddenly if they want to adopt AI they don't even know how they can use it. Uh so there has to be tremendous amount of

skilling. Uh there has to be uh easy cheap infrastructure upgrade options available. So something like what NRA semi is building IoT devices u which can be deployed easily uh to do

to monitor uh to monitor the quality of the product to monitor the machines u um u uh raise alarms before the machines go down. Um so those are a tremendous amount of opportunities for startups uh

using AI um and basically deploy it at scale across the country. Um we have thousands and thousands of factories around the country and we have to do it on a cluster bycluster basis one at a

time. Um there's no other way to do it because everyone else is adopting it around the world and we have to adopt it as well. But do you see it as a shared model as an infrastructure for

&gt;&gt; I a shared model? Yes. Because no one company is going to have enough data to train their own AI models, right? Uh so you have to have shared data. Uh and to that effect the government has also

created something called as the AI kosh. Uh where they are aggregating the data from many industries, many companies together. Of course they anonymize the data. So a new company coming in can

train their data on this existing data. So definitely shared infrastructure. Government is also providing um GPU access at affordable rates. So where companies can now create their own AI

agents. Uh so there's a lot of stuff that the government is doing. I just don't think it is uh people know about it and just like ISM is such a big thing. Sure.

&gt;&gt; Uh but I think on the manufacturing side, government is doing stuff but people just don't know about it. &gt;&gt; We'll we'll come back to that probably is that pri you lead innovation right so

you get to see a lot of you know the the so-called as a ground level innovation coming up as part of your innovation challenge and we are talking about this whole AI which spans all kind of

infrastructures and data and everything. So in this development of AI uh what do you think is the is the focus should be specifically if we have to make the development and deployment uh is

something which is safe or trusted and and then maybe call it responsible or ethical AI. &gt;&gt; Yep. Yeah. This this uh thanks thanks no bringing this point u and this is not

only true for AI u uh it I would say this is something you know which is uh market specific. So uh let let me start with the example. Uh at NXP we are world leader in automotive semiconductors.

Okay. So what if you buy a toy car and if it is not working on day one what you going to do? Probably you'll go back to your vendor and tell that you know hey you know give me a replacement this guy

is not working or give me a refund. [clears throat] But what if you buy a new car and your braking system or airbag are not working on day one. Can you just think of that? There's a life

behind the wheel all the time and you want that kind of reliability on day one until the end of the life. You know if the car is say for uh you know for 10 years you're using on the 10th year you

still expect the airbags to work the way it should be on the day one. Okay. So similarly coming to the context of AI you know the deployment of AI if I need to deploy it in a automotive vehicle

then I expect the same level of you know the same level of reliability same level of trust. Okay. Uh let me give you another example. Namin was sharing you know 40% in financials. Let me talk

about healthcare. Okay. Suppose if there's some AI in deployment and there's a hospital where we are delivering say 10 babies or say 100 babies a day. Can you expect even

missing a single delivery out of it? We just can't say hey you know AI goofed up and we missed one delivery. No there's a human life behind it. Okay. So depending upon the sector you know uh

the I would say the trustworthiness or ethics comes into play ID should be there. I feel ethics are still underplayed in the whole AI context because uh you know if there are like 10

people in the room almost probably eight to nine you know out of those 10 either would be using AI as a customer or probably you know developing it. But how many of us are working towards ethics?

Let me bring another point here. the biased data okay or we say the data poisoning because if you start poisoning this data over the time the AI or chat GPT is going to you know use this data

and give you outcome okay uh I still see a little biased crowd here because we have only couple of diverse candidates we say that men at the work if you if you're driving typically in India you'll

say oh men at work because women's can't work so if this AI guy takes a you know uh uh you know answer out of this the chat GP picks up this up okay men's can only

works can't work so then the chat GPT is going to take up a decision which would be gender biased because this is something we have seen since our you know childhood we say that

this man hours of resources we need these are humans you know that human could be man or you some other gender. So all these you know all these small

you know minute things needs to be you know uh come into play while we are developing AI it's for good thing okay and the all technology has a you know you know a dark or a light side of it

but at the same time I think this whole frameworks of having uh uh uh you know unbiased information and check and balances and then government needs to you know play a role and every single uh

single I would say individual has to come and uh you know plug into their view from as a individual as a you know theme or MSME or a government or bodies like IES where we ensure whatever we are

developing is trustworthy okay we really want efficiency we want things before I click but at the same time if this is not trustworthy sorry I don't need it hope that helps

&gt;&gt; sure thank you &gt;&gt; sure good points uh uh so I think we talked about the opportunities in the first round let's get into some of the deployment part of it Right. And and

again Jatis I'll start with you again. Right. Uh mostmemes run on the what we call as the legacy IT machines the fragmented data right uh and and then it's the hardest part right probably

that you are on the legacy not on the latest and greatest. Now if we are building an edge AI or embedded AI infra and and then all of these together the the models the compute and the infra

together uh how do you think we cross this roadblock and and enable this deployment acrossmemes and startups &gt;&gt; so uh I think uh it's a great uh problem to solve probably the India's

opportunity is there right so right Now the the the the manufacturing forms or SMMES they don't uh like AI for example is because it uh AI deployment means you have to send all the data uh out and you

will not have access to this whole big AI model sitting out there and you you really don't know whether uh and also the cost wise how to is is uh is it cost effective to send all these high

bandwidth data and get it uh process processed and uh the the AWS expenses the the broadband expenses all those things are almost uh unaffordable for many of the manufacturing as well as

SMMES. So here uh my point here is the optimal AI is the is the uh is the way forward how AI can be optimized for better deployments or cost effective deployments and that is when it is it

will really be attractive formemes and the manufacturing sector and it it needs okay of course it is not available today uh without sending data this LLM will not work and is that a a challenge or is

that an opportunity? I would say it is a great opportunity for new developments, new uh like uh investment on AI. So there are uh Indian startups and Indianmemes can invest heavily for

tapping this opportunity, the optimal AI opportunity. Right now it is not the optimal AI opportunity. It is the is the it's the server form opportunity which India has already lost. uh that is the

story right server farm opportunity is there for the players who have already deployed uh like giga uh the huge number of uh GPUs and electricity and all those things right

and of course they will be pushing for uh India to follow the same line but is that what India wants should we invest on uh gigatons of electricity should we invest on huge foreign exchange India

India's choice of AI uh scale probably is different we can tap the the uh the Indian uh talent the the the democratic uh what is that the demographic dividend to create a a a model or optimized

models deployable models which are good for the Indian industry and if you do that what you do you create huge huge amount of jobs which is not the SAS jobs. Of course, it will be product

jobs. We can create uh we can make India a product nation by tapping this opportunity. The opportunity the opportunity a new opportunity which is not tapped by the big players yet. So

that is what I would push for. Make AI deployable. Make AI optimized so that even smallcale manufacturing units can make use of it. And Anand you wanted to add

&gt;&gt; I I agree. I think the is the my my my assertion is I don't think we are lacking the data centers are the problem statement right I don't think algorithms are the problem statement the GPU

compute is a I think the fundamental unit that is stopping is the trust right how do you trust and how do you build trust into the into the system right whether we do things like at the edge to

build that trust keep the data at a trust that's one the second thing we I think we need to really think about is the cost of intelligence is going to go to zero Okay. Right now think about it.

Right. The best companies in the world, they had all the access to the best technologies and people and talent. But now with this whole LLMs or the science foundation models that are coming out or

the robotics foundation models that are coming out, the cost of intelligence is really coming down to zero. So the question is how do you use that and scale and build world-class companies on

top of it, right? because that is no longer we can't no longer say that oh you don't have that uh this one right so my assertion is it's not I think AI is going to happen uh it's

it's driving things at a scale the question is how do you uh move the discussion from the data center to the manufacturing flow right how do you make India the world leader in in

manufacturing and that's where ISA and uh and the team here right is we need to really think about right is how do you bring this augment the human plus the AI to like you know be world leaders in at

the manufacturing floor uh and deploy and create world class uh products right because that's an opportunity that nobody has tackled right and that's that's something to think about

&gt;&gt; yeah so so I think we'll build sep and and then an anan both of you right uh and then probably you give an Indian context and you give a global right uh what AI use cases are already giving or

deliverabing measurable ROI And especially if I talk about logistics, manufacturing, whether it's services, right? Industrial and all of that. Uh do you have some

examples that you see it around from India? A couple of examples global and then then can we replicate that to dozens and hundreds and thousands? &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. See, I think as I said

earlier, right? Um, one of the biggest problems is people don't know what AI can do for them and especially the small scale industries which are legacy uh ways of operation. Uh, so they don't

see an ROI. So there's initial cost or barrier to entry is high. Um, it may be a few lakh rupees, it may be tens of lakhs of rupees. Um, so they see this. So the barrier to entry is high and

[clears throat] as said the government is trying to help over there but I think more than that what there's a large scale education that needs to happen across the board

where people are made aware of what AI can do for them in their manufacturing industry and reading up on this u what I have seen is uh inventory management is number one basically uh you know you can

overstock or you can undertock you can uh and to reduce that inventory costs are high so to reduce that overhead uh AI does a very good job right how to make your supply chain extremely

efficient uh second uh is in terms of machine downtime so if you have good machine monitoring right your machine goes down suddenly your production stop, you're going to

have a huge loss, right? Versus if you can look at uh energy spikes in your machine, for example, or the amount of vibration that is happening in a machine, that can tell you that your

machine is due for maintenance, something's not right, and before the machine goes down, you can repair it. So, so these are the kind of things where there is a huge ROI and then the

whole logistics as you mentioned right uh raw material coming in it's getting processed through five different stages or 10 different stages and then finally going out as a finished product

each stage I mean we see it in our industry also the RTL is ready DV is struggling or physical design is struggling uh and uh so you know the data is ready but there's no one to take

it. Uh so that kind of logistics management is also very well handled by I and that is the core of how AI can help the manufacturing industry. &gt;&gt; Got it. Sure. Anand some here. uh

I think at the global scale the we are like every month we are seeing new and new use cases uh that is flooring everybody right and my prediction is in [snorts]

is across not just coding right people talk about coding right but across industries whether it's software deploy uh uh software development whether it is uh legal marketing uh marcom and the

whole shebang I the the industry is going to get reset by a wide margin, right? Especially entry- level jobs. I really really worry about kids that are graduating in the next couple of uh

years. Frankly, I have a son in college. I don't even know what to advise him anymore uh at this stage, right? So, uh specific examples, right? I think given the ISA here right is we are seeing a

nonlinear change in how uh things that used to take days and uh weeks we're able to reduce it down like in physical simulation right we're able to reduce it down to like literally hours or minutes

right you're seeing like close to 1000x improvement in speed of how we are uh doing physics simulations right plasma simulations uh materials uh uh discovery in terms of contract discussion

like it takes nearly a week for uh for the best law firms in India or US and they charge you arm and length to to do so right it takes them weeks to turn around and stuff like that we were able

to turn around these things within 15 minutes and they able to catch errors which a large team of 10 12 people are not able to to catch and they're like oh yeah we missed that one right I think

that the speed at which this is going and this is going to have a significant implications on the on the job market. I think we're underestimating what AI can do today.

&gt;&gt; Sure. Yeah. I think those are good examples. Uh Pri coming back to you, right? You brought up that topic again mean I want to just build very concrete actions from there, right? Means AI

ethics. Yes, I acknowledge it's a it's a big problem ahead for us an opportunity forever. What what actions do we take? uh or or depending on whether it's it's government role to do that it's a as

industry uh or or who plays what role in in in managing this AI ethics. &gt;&gt; Yep. So uh Nin before going there uh let me start with uh each one of us sitting

in this room each one of us at least written one exam in our lifetime. So what we do in that exam you know there's a question paper and you attempt an answer to it. Okay. Or I would say

there's a well- definfined problem statement and we you know give answer to that well- definfined problem statement here. The problem statement itself is not well defined. Okay. So the you know

the situation where I don't know what I don't know is really killing and that's where exactly we are when it comes to you know AI ethics and you know responsible or trustworthy who would do

it you know who owns that trustworthiness who owns that certification of you know this is a responsible AI model you should use it that one is not responsible okay so uh

and and the context keep on changing I'll and since I come from you know automotive semiconductor background let me give give you a you know uh example and that's in Indian context okay

there's an autonous vehicle on the road and uh the situation is uh such that you know there's a cow and a buffalo on the road which one you will hit and you need to you know at the end of it one has to

be you know hit it out so now the question comes which state of India you are driving you know so it's not you know that the one size or one contact fits all you know within

this uh you know demography of India which state you are driving would decide whether you to hit a cow or a fellow and now we talking about a AI which is globally accepted you know globally

trustworth is trustworthy or globally ethically correct okay so it's it's it's like one size doesn't fit all so it has to be you know probably either domain specific sector specific or region

specific you know something which works everywhere in India but may not be in this particular state part of it. And and US is not different. If you go US the driving laws are different in one

state to other state. If you're driving in Texas, the laws are say you know 50 miles uh per hour but if you go to Florida things would change. Okay. No bias to the present president of US but

things are different already you know these are there in the books. Okay. So now coming back to you know how do we solve this problem? So this has to be solved uh first at the concept level.

You know I talk about safety and security because functional safe is the the best thing in automotive and so do it applies to AI that by concept security safety or trustworthiness has

to be there you know it should not happen so that you know I have developed something and now I start you know making it secure. So it's like you know you have constructed a beautiful home

and at the end of it you said oh well I need to safeguard it. What you'll do you put a big iron gate at the entrance okay so that no one can get into the house but let's assume someone get in inside

the house already then you need to secure every single room okay let's assume someone gets into the room as well you know with some authentication then you want to safeguard that

metallics locker which is sitting in everyone's home. So same goes with AI's trustworthiness and I would say ethics that it has to be with concept at every single level

and then this needs to be monitored throughout end of its life. It's not that you have some ethics or some safety norms you know being deployed today. It is trustworthy on 1st January 2026. What

happens first January 20 30 or 35 things might change. The world is evolving. The technology is rapidly growing. So there should be check and balancing throughout the phase of this part you know I would

say the AI deployment I call it as a product it's not only you know because what is true today might not be true tomorrow true okay and it's then uh it's responsible responsibility of every

single individual you know uh as a user as well because if as a user I find a loophole and I'm little biased towards one particular community or one particular you know technology domain

I'll not raise the voice okay so there should be a open feedback forum uh you know there should be a open mechanism where anyone or everyone can give you know uh that okay this is something I

find not trustworthy it could be a trustworthiness otherwise in the other part of it okay so this has to be from the concept till end of the light and you know all the check and balances and

then government uh has to play a you know important role because ultimately you know uh why we don't you know uh most of the if you see the young youngsters they said Oh, you know we'll

need to you know put the seat belt or you know put in a helmet because there could be cops on the you know on the external roads but internally that works because internally there would be

nothing. So this you know this mandate should not be enforced you know but there has to be check and balances there should be some uh policies around it but policies are good laws are met not to be

broken but at the at the same time every individual has to be you know responsible adopting and you know giving a a fair judgment as you need to remind pre the way works in California, Texas

and Texas and and Arizona. So I think people are are adopting and making it work. &gt;&gt; True. Okay. We have we'll we'll come to the audience. We can have few questions

there. If you can raise your hand, introduce yourself, ask a question and please ask which panelist you are asking that for and please questions only not comments.

&gt;&gt; Good morning. Uh my name is Arun Sharma. I work for company called Aren Electricals and uh the question is in this title of AI at scale there is a race to

race to put deploy AI at the fastest but the the basic thing which for last three days I'm attending this events in other other domains like telecom or anything the standardization is done first no

people sit down together. What is to be done? This has not been talked so far. What could have been the reason? The question is for Naven &gt;&gt; for me

&gt;&gt; because because you are you &gt;&gt; sure you are supposed to ask questions not answer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So so so point is like I think we are doing the two uh things

both parallel. We see an opportunity and we have started to go and start building the infra and then the the upper layer and then finally the use case and the applications. And while we were figuring

out saying what comes out as a standards versus what kept as a loophole and I think same thing existed for some time in other like if you go back to the mobile 5G even the first version of data

center that came in right there was this about like mean even take for example right we started as GPU as the as the so-called as a compute was all GPU we slowly started figuring out that it's

not feasible cost power many other angles and we started going into saying like you know what are other use cases and then based on that then start coming into saying cloud versus edge and all of

that. So I think we are more in exploration a very early exploration still and and then as we move forward some of this will start becoming a guardrails or a standards or a policy or

something that will happen. So I think we are on that journey right now rather than trying to say that this is how it would be. &gt;&gt; Maybe I I can add to that. uh so uh

Indian government actually can do a lot of things right even some of the rules set the growth right one of the uh rules which is probably good for uh the the the society is privacy and security

could be one of the biggest pillars right that itself could create a huge growth uh Indiacentric growth for the industry right the moment you put security as one of the paramount thing

for surveillance think about the opportunities inmemes and the startups which can create because a new set of platforms need to evolve and a new set of uh chips needs to evolve a new set of

solutions need to come up and even integration jobs uh need to be revised and India could can do all those things because uh even though we are a rapidly growing nation we are still at the early

stage so this is a good time for setting the roots &gt;&gt; right right Okay, there's a question here. &gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Karthik. I'm a lawyer. My

question is to the full panel. Uh at the lower level in the legal circle, it's actually quite easy to see where AI can help. In fact, I would say that the lower level at the lower level, we can

completely replace all all lawyers. But the question the problem is that liability insurance is something that only a human being can take. So how is it that we can scale at the lower levels

without a liability insurance being provided? no charge GP or anyone will take liability insurance on behalf of their agents or on behalf of the app being deployed. So my question is in

that context I I don't know I I don't think any of us is qualified enough to talk about this but uh li when you say liability insurance on behalf of the lawyer or on

behalf of the tool. So on behalf of the lawyer because if a lawyer is being replaced by a tool uh a client can't sue the tool right he can sue a lawyer for for making error in judgment or

providing wrong information right &gt;&gt; yeah I I don't know if anyone has an answer to this but it's like whether you trust whether when a Tesla auto drive crashes who do you sue do you sue Tesla

or do you sue the driver sitting in the car who's not got his hands on the steering wheel probably we can take lessons from there but maybe an if Do you have any comments?

&gt;&gt; I love my Tesla. I I drive it without thinking uh from work to home every day and I don't drive. All right. So, but the end of the day if I get into a crash, my wife reminds me was you'll pay

for it. So, [laughter] so you are responsible. I think what you see the liability there'll still be a law firm. The question is does it needs 10,000 people in that law firm, right? Answer

is clearly a no at this stage. Right? That's that's what the impact is. There will be somebody who will take a liability for it. People will get paid for it and people will figure out that

mechanisms for it. Same thing you enter you drive into or have the way more drop you versus an Uber driving you. Right? End of the day if the Whimo crashes Google is bearing it to some extent. I

think people are figuring it out. I I'm I'm saying that is not going to hold up the system, right? I think people a lot of people think that oh all these issues are going to hold up things. there's so

much free flowing happening right now. I I don't think there's any stoppage around how this is going to affect the job market. &gt;&gt; The only way I'll add to that is that

when we also like mean I come from the chip design. I generate some things from these AI tools but I don't use it as it is human in the loop is always a constant thing across all of that. So I

go and validate that probably build on that and then go ahead and do it because if that software if that piece of design does not work finally it's on me. Okay. Uh I think we are maybe we'll just last

question very quick very quick right and then &gt;&gt; hi sir my name is yes. Uh I'm a student I'm a tech guy also. So my question is in the part on the data centers uh

because as you told about the security part uh most of the banks and bfs sector they already on the part of the on- premises data center because they don't want to lost their datas. uh but in the

part if you building a data center in India India and how you can uh provide the global uh access the reason is that like in AWS or GP GCP and that kind of uh things you're saying they are

available in global regions but in Indian data centers if they are building how we can access that data at US also in that efficient way because if you loading something in your servers it's

within a second within a micro millisecond how we can go ahead in that part if you're building data center in India and how we can scale it at commercial level in the global level.

Okay, Sunday if you want to start and we'll quick answer I think &gt;&gt; quick answer I think uh all of that is built into the system from the day I mean there's Yata who's building lot of

data centers across India uh they build that into the system which is basically they look at the latency of response uh and data is available everywhere just like go GCP or AWS or Azure uh the

latency is the number one consideration uh for the time of response. Yeah. So yeah any &gt;&gt; and the hybrid compute model is a is the way to go because it can be a shared

compute model where some um which sensitive data could be processed in promise and metadata could go out right so there are &gt;&gt; yeah so so we'll probably give you an

answer later as well but if the global data center does it any data center that comes in India from India for India to global will also replicate that and make it work so the problem is kind of solved

and we'll have to replicate that. Okay. Uh but thank you everyone. I know uh the time is up. Uh quickly just to summarize right I think all of us believe uh AI is here for us to leverage not just for

writing code or or generative contents but also to take up to our manufacturing and the MSSE sector. Uh there are a lot of grants, subsidies, policies that the government of India has enabled through

part of the India emission. I only heard one feedback saying how do we make people aware of it that these policies are a available as well as AI can solve some things probably that's something is

an opportunity to go and add to that uh but we need to go beyond data center to edge leverage this take it beyond with less connectivity much smaller model solve that uh have a specific problem to

solve rather than trying to think of exit and the IPO and then as we do it we need to do it in a sustainable and an ethical way so So that's the summary of the discussion that we had. Thank you

everyone once again and good luck for the rest of the day. Thank you.
