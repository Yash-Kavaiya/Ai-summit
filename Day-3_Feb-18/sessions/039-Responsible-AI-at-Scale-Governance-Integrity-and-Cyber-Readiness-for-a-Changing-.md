## 📝 Transcript

can be during the end. One speaker is &gt;&gt; okay. I welcome everyone and for me and for everyone here we would all agree it is a privilege

quite honestly a responsibility as well and I'll explain why I say so because let's admit we are living in an age where artificial intelligence writes poetry

drives cars diagnose diseases and occasionally recommends things we never searched For AI is powerful but power without guardrails is chaos. The real question is can we build

intelligence that is responsible? Can we scale innovation without scaling vulnerability? That brings us to our panel. Responsible AI at scale, governance, integrity and

cyber readiness for a changing world. Not theory, not speculation, but execution. To steer this conversation, we have someone who has consistently argued that cyber security is not a

technical sidebar. It is a national priority. a digital peaceuilder, a cyber security advocate, founder and global president of cyberpace.

Please join me in welcoming Major Vinit Kumar. Sir, over to you. [applause] So, very good morning to everyone. It's a really a proud pleasure and a privilege to be here part of the panel

and uh we are all here at the AI impact summit and joined by esteemed panel here. I'll do the introductions here. They're all heavy weights by the way. So there's a long long kind of bio that I

got online by just doing a chart GPT. So I had to use chat GPT again to cut it short. So uh again esteemed panelist uh the global leader colleagues who are here in the room. We have been joined by

some delegations from different countries who are there in the room. Uh Cyberpace uh for those who are new to Cyberpace, we are a uh global nonprofit headquartered in India. Uh we are a

volunteer-driven organization and as the words suggest we talk about amalgamation of peace in the cyber space trying to keep cyberpace safe, cyerspace safe, secure and resilient for everyone. Uh

and we gather here today at a very pivotal moment. It's not just technology uh evolution but it is also human decision in making. Uh AI is scaling faster than any uh I will say technology

in the history of the mankind. It is shaping economies uh redefining security influencing information ecosystems and also transforming the way societies function. Yet the true test of progress

is not how fast we innovate but how responsibly we scale. Today's conversation on responsible AI at scale, governance, integrity, and cyber readiness is not about abstract

principle. It's about national resilience. It's about democratic trust and is about economic opportunity that the space has to offer. And it is also about global stability. India stands

uniquely positioned as a digital powerhouse as a democracy at scale and as a voice for the global south to shape the global narrative on trusted AI. The question before us is clear. With the

distinguished leaders that we have today on the stage and with the esteemed audience that we have here in the crowd, I am confident that this discussion will move from aspiration to action. And so

let us begin. We are joined by a very esteemed panelist and we have uh a video message also uh that we'll play during the end. We have Mr. Jay Bavisi uh founder and

group president of uh EC council as one of the panelist we have uh and Jay is by the way let me read out a quick bio about Jay thanks binu and thanks subie for joining in

quickly now that makes the panel complete and also if you see it's a balanced panel and I'm the moderator I'm the one standing out so thank you again thanks for joining in so Jay is actually

the founder and group president of EC council a global leader in cyber security certification ation and workforce development trusted by seven of the fortune 10 companies. There's a

long long list of his kind of achievements and all but I'll just say that uh again he's a powerhouse when we talk about cyber security and one thing that I recollect that people knew EC

council through the famous certifi certified ethical hacker certification when Jay had introduced it way back much ages ago I would say we are also joined by another uh speaker uh Ki uh thanks

again for joining in uh Ki is the director and head of public policy or APJC of Cloudflare. Kali is a geopolitical strategist and head of public policy for Asia-Pacific, Japan,

China at Cloudflare. Pardon me if I'm reading something wrong. This is what uh I got it from Chad GPT and I've just put it here together. So, and yeah, [laughter]

so based in Singapore, she actually leads regional engagement at the intersection of emerging technology, digital sovereignty and also cyber resilience. And we know Cloudflare uh in

fact has been a great I mean supporter to what cyberpace is doing. We done series of builderthons with IITs and different academic institution and we've got some excellent innovation thanks to

Cloudflare for supporting it. We have also been joined by again a dear friend a a longtime dear friend uh Subie Chhaturvedi uh global senior vice president and chief corporate affairs

and public policy officer of inmobi a longtime supporter of cyberpace when probably we had started in the early days and subie had been one person who had been behind us that guys you should

move forward so she's again a powerhouse supporting cyber peace and the initiative [snorts] uh she she actually leads global strategy across public policy uh regulatory engagement and

corporate affairs, a recognized voice in digital governance and technical uh policy diplomacy. Next speaker that we have is all the way from Russia and uh thank you Anna for

joining and that too at a very short notice uh associate professor of St. Petersburg State University. Anna is a associate professor specializing in international governance, digital

regulations and emerging technology policy. Her research focused on comparative AI governance models, multilateral coordination and intersection of national regulatory

systems with global institutional framework and the place where has helped uh cyber piece a lot is also working on the cyber piece global index the first index that emerges from the global south

and I request you maybe in your speech you can also mention about that the work that we have done where responsible AI ethical AI is one of the verticals that we have focused and you should see that

live by at the end of year. We announced that during the internet governance forum in 2025 followed by that the UN cyber convention in Vietnam when we had the expert roundt and the second expert

round table at cyberpace summit in the same place bhat mandapam just a week ago. Uh we have uh again a great leader Binu all the way from India to US and from US to India that's what Binu is

trying to do and trying to give back to society at large. So, Binu is the CEO and co-founder of Cyber, a global cyber uh security intelligence company specializing threat intelligence,

digital risk uh monitoring and dark web analytics. I'm sure we know you'll be speaking about it and the way cyber has been doing trying to create that ecosystem and also the way you are

helping Shuraka catalyst and trying to bring up that entire ecosystem to get startups from India to the US. So, so that's where Binu has been instrumental and would look forward to hearing your

views. And finally, uh we have our very own uh left general Rajesh Pansa, former national cyber coordinator to government of India and member of the global advisory council of cyber peace.

Lieutenant General Pant uh served as a national cyber coordinator where he led national cyber security strategy and inter agency coordination across government, defense and critical

sectors. More on General Pant. If you just do a Google search, in fact, not just P General Pant, if you search their names on Google, you'll get the entire bios. I'm just cutting it short because

the timer is clicking and I'm going a little fast. So with that I would like to uh in fact invite our first speaker uh because we know uh AI and the need of AI we have seen a lot of interesting use

cases go talk about any sector uh any particular se segment that you go AI has been a great enabler but with all good things we have something to tackle and that is where we talk about AI safety

and basically the misuse of AI uh deep fake AI generated misinformation there are several other challenges that are happening. So how can we counter that and make sure that AI scales and this is

what we are going to talk about AI scaling of uh artificial intelligence in the era of agentic AI uh and several other kind of new innovations that are happening. So I am going to invite a

very first speaker uh Dr. Subie uh and my question to Subie here is that we hear a lot about responsible AI principles Subie but implementation is where countries struggle. Where does

responsible AI governance look like in practice especially when we talk about population the scaling population and how does government industry academia and civil society share responsibility

to make it real and let me also share everyone that couple 2023 when cyberpace was doing the summit we were doing as part of the G20 summit on trust and safety we also had released the fist

framework where Subie has been uh the main I would say person behind frameworks. I'll request sub to share a brief on that as well. And my only request to all the speakers is the time.

So please check the time and please try to limit yourself as quick as possible. And we have a expert uh I would say a surprise speaker for all of you. Uh this morning I got a call from Suresh sir

from the Commonwealth Secretariat and uh I just told him I saw him in the room sir that we need to hear your voice also. So I will invite you at the end sir to share your remarks on the entire

uh basically the deliberation that happened. So Suresh uh in fact I had the opportunity of working with Suresh uh in the Commonwealth Secretariat where we uh were part of a consortium on AI for the

industry academia civil society and I had a chance to contribute and he was leading all that conversation there. He is right now the director at the Commonwealth Secretariat. So I'll invite

you sir also to share your remarks. Over to you Subie. Thank you. Thank you, Venit. Thank you for doing this incredible job of stitching the entire panel together, getting us all in the

room and it's a drizzly morning. Thank you for all of you that you showed up in such strength and numbers. I think why we're all here is really important and this conversation strikes at the heart

of it. So, I come from a company called InMobi. Inobi is India's first unicorn. We became a unicorn when this was not a buzzword. Um this was built by people who came from Kpur from Uttar Pradesh

and if we were a country we jokingly say we'd be the fifth largest country in the world. We solve for things at population scale and which is why understanding this is so important. My journey started

from telecom and that's where policy industry media academia government and so therefore this panel is sit so well together that you have representation without each of us playing our rightful

roles and that's how the vis defines internet governance the journey between telecom and internet is very very different so when we're talking about responsible AI you are not just solving

for the air conditioning you will not just look at models from the west where we'll put privacy First, yes, it's very very important. We talk about privacy by design. But when you look at this summit

being hosted for the first time in the global south, you're looking at solutions. You're looking at proliferation. You're looking at access. You're looking at connecting the

unconnected. And all of that cannot happen without frameworks that solve for transparency, that solve for accountability, that solve for inclusion. So when we created our second

unicorn, that's called Glance. It sits on top of the lock screen without unlocking the phone. 550 million devices and that means about 55 cr people access content for the first time. That's the

first interaction that they have with the internet using the mobile phone without ever having to download an application. So what are we solving for and what is at stake? It's freedom. It's

integrity. each time you don't look at sovereign models that are inclusive, equitable and that's why we say integrity is at the heart of every single conversation that we'll have and

I'm so glad that we have representation from almost all countries that matter that make up more than 60% of the world's internet. So that's the power of the voice that is in the room. What do

we look for? Therefore, we came up with the fist framework together with cyberpace. We launched it with USI, the United Service Institute of India and with support from Mastercard and Tata

Suns and we say FIS puts integrity, safety and trust at the heart of every single conversation. I come from academia and this is where you know conversations around ensuring that the

nerds, geeks, developers need to be in the room. So we need to solve for access, we need to solve for compute, we need to solve for talent. That's where India will always win. 40% of AI's

talent sits in this country but we need to make sure that they're being utilized. 40% of all uh women in STEM are from this country. We need to make sure by the time the funnel tapers down

to professional integration and that's why you don't just need to be getting a seat at the table in case you have to you need to also build your own table and you need to be that voice in the

room. So frameworks need to solve for creating a data intelligent nation. They will not just embibe western models. They will create our own models. And that's why the jam tinity that's where

digital India which our prime minister created in 2014 really matters. And that is why when you layer batnet on top of it which is connecting all 600,000 villages of India, 250,000 village

punchads and local self-governments. So applications, use cases, getting integrity to understand that AI can only be countered by AI and misinformation, disinformation are very very real risk

that we need to solve for. So watermarking looking at examples like Venitz put together something called the trust trace. How do we make sure that you tell the person in the village that

it's not just stitching videos and images that everything that you see needs to be questioned. So watermarks are important. So social media companies will need to step up and show a little

more in terms of accountability. You need to make sure that you don't take away the thing that is most essential and which is trust. So responsible frameworks will not just happen in

countries from the west. They will come out from the global south from island nations from landlock countries. And we need to make sure critical infrastructure is going to be at the

heart of every single conversation. We need to make sure that once young girls and women come online, not revenge porn, not gender based violence and technologyled violence, technology

mediated violence. So those are the conversations that we need to solve for. We need to stop treating young people just as consumers. They need to be start they need to be treated as equal

stakeholders. So India created proumers. We are producers as well as consumers. And that's the model that's working everywhere. So getting a seat on the table and I'm most excited that people

such so many young people are in the room, so many young girls are in the room. You've already made the first right step. You've shown up. You are you are sitting here. Every time a

consultation comes out, a draft note comes out. Please participate. Please put in your recommendations. And the last thing that I want to leave you with are there are five AR organizations.

There's the ITU, there's ISO, there's IETF where standards are written, codes are written. Please show up in great numbers. So my three years at the United Nations Internet Governance Forum, we

advocated very strongly for at least two seats for the youth community to be part of the multistakeholder advisory group. That's the group that advises the United Nations Secretary General. We did 18

main sessions. is we created a dedicated best practice forum where we are countering and mitigating gender based violence. So we have to ensure and it's our collective responsibility that not

only will you get more people online once they come online they will be safe and AI frameworks in particular and that's the very very important thing under consideration each time you don't

create models that come out of here you leave about 11,000 billion US dollars on the table we cannot afford to do that the contribution that AI is going to make is larger than the combined GDP of

India and China so more use cases in agri techch solve for the farmer in meat and bellendur and and hubli and dharad solve for the young student who will need remedial education that's what AI

is solving for it's solving for teacher training ratios so what vene has done here through a multistakeholder panel and cyberpace as an intervention where government academia civil society and

the public sector sits together that's the most perfect model to ensure AI is responsible and AI is equitable. Venit, I'll stop here. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Subie. And uh

thanks for setting up the entire context also. And yes, it's always the case when you are speaking. So [laughter] thank you again and uh with Subie. Now I want to move on to Anna and you wear

multiple hats Anna but uh you're also associate professor of uh St. Petersburg University. And we when we talk about inclusivity we talk about accessibility in all the conversation I think the role

of the nonprofits nos's civil society and the people at large becomes very critical also academia so I want you to wear both the hats and share maybe how NOS's can adopt AI and NOS's and also

I'll add academia can adopt AI and turn knowledge into sustainable and social impact. Uh you can also share your experiences from the coordination lab. So over to you Anna please.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; It works. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it works. &gt;&gt; So good afternoon everyone. It's great to be here in India. Uh so in my as as

my experience shows um I'm a professor. I work as an expert as leading researcher and also as CEO of nonprofit coordination lab. And uh what I see is that most institution like states,

universities, uh research institutes they cannot transform that fast. So even even if they generally want to. So yeah, of course large tech uh large tech companies they can but uh everyone else

struggles and uh as a CEO of nonprofit uh I believe that small uh agile organizations uh can turn uh away AI wave uh to stable public value. Um because our main problem today uh as a

society as a humanity is actually speed. speed because of AI development. So, uh the problem is how to keep up without losing quality, legitimacy and trust. Uh and one of the answers that I can give

uh is that we have uh to scale impact uh by um uniting three uh three things. Uh the first is uh open knowledge. uh the second is community and the third is regular updates and that's why uh our

organization uh together with leading research universities in Russia we developed a living textbook on uh research in and teaching uh in the age of AI but to have only one textbook it's

not enough so that's why we also develop uh infrastructure around it. So we made a researchers club uh summer school and also a program which is called AI from zero uh for those who feel like left

behind of this development and of course it's very important to have uh like uh partnership uh partnership among academia uh partnership with tech technological

companies because without speaking with those who uh who develop AI, it's impossible to understand like all these practical aspects uh and of course international

cooperation. So that's why we are really happy to uh support uh cyber peace initiatives uh to support uh bricks uh council work uh uh on AI. we're doing analytics for uh bricks uh and different

other uh initiatives. So uh thank you very much. I I I don't want to take a lot of time but uh really great to be here. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Anna. Thank you so

much for your uh brief uh introduction and uh uh in fact I'll next if we get time I'd like to come and speak to you on the index part of it on how index can be the point to measure responsible

ethical AI and when countries and how can countries kind of implement it. So something that I'll like to have you in the next set of conversation if time permits. Now with that I'd like to move

to you Carly. In fact uh and uh my question to you is that there's a growing recognition that responsible AI is not just a governance question but a cyber resilience question. What does

cyber readiness actually look like for AI systems in practice and how should governments and enterprises and also I'll add academia. So government, academia and different enterprises,

enterprises of all sizes, MSMES, uh included builds resilience across full AI life cycle. So over to you Kie for your remarks. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Excuse me.

[clears throat] So for those of you who don't know Cloudflare, um Cloudflare is a a global digital infrastructure company. Um our network spans 125 countries, uh 330

cities, 30 of those are in India. um from like tier one, tier two, tier three. Um we start this is an important point and this is why we work with cyberpace is that we started um in cyber

security protecting websites um and now we're moving into AI security as we we're 15 years along we've growing um but we started with a free plan um and that's why 20% of the internet runs

through our network. It's uh millions and millions and millions of customers that rely on our free cyber security services and increasingly on our AI security services. And I do want to say

that our partnership with Cyberpace is really focused on um access and enablement. And so where we started, it's the first time we've ever done this globally. I want to say what we're doing

with cyberpace is is unique to Cloudflare globally. And we're very proud of our our partnership with cyberpace. The first thing we did is we did a training uh for Indianmemes

on how just to use our free cyber security services. this is how you log in. Takes about five minutes. Um it's and and it was a very special moment for us as a team actually to do that. So

thank you Venique for your partnership. Um but Cloudflare like I said we're a digital infrastructure company. We are basically a middleman. We sit in between in between our customers and their

users. Okay. And and the internet basically, right? The world, right? And so we protect stuff that's going into our customers and we help our customers protect what's going out to their users.

So we get to see this really neat flow of traffic. Um and on the AI side, what we're noticing is a unbelievable increase in cyber security attacks. So 53% Okay, so Cloudflare has been

protecting our customers against DOS attacks since we started. This past year we've seen a 53% increase in DOS attacks and what we call monster DOS attacks, which is one uh terabyte per second or

more. Um we've seen a 20% increase in the past few months on these attacks and so we can see that AI is just driving an incredible amount of cyber security. Thankfully Cloudflare

has been using machine learning for since we started and now increasingly AI so we're able to like absorb these attacks and that's our job is to absorb these attacks but um you know it is a

new landscape right and so how do we think about AI security? Cthar is building AI security tools but I think we're trying to think about the principles of AI security and I think

there are lessons learned from cyber security right I don't think there's we think about and I think it was mentioned in the in the opening comments like it shouldn't just be an add-on security

like we have learned from lessons from the past so when the internet was created it was built with security principles at all so we had to bolt-on security to the internet can there's a

moment now where we can build with security with AI I think that's what we need to be focused on about responsible AI is it's built into the products. We're shipping products that have

built-in security in them. I think that's something we really need to think about. And it's going to get tricky, I think, with agentic AI. &gt;&gt; Yes.

&gt;&gt; You're going to have this little bot walking around with a key to all of your assets. Like, how do we even think about that? &gt;&gt; Like, when it when it goes and does

something wrong, when it just unleashes all your data or spends all your money, who's at fault? How do we track it? How do we keep how do we authenticate it? These are questions I think that

globally they're starting to consider. So you know the the the big golden standard and we talk about how does this relate to India? How does India become a leader in setting standards typically

the big glo global standard for setting cyber security standards is NIST in the United States. Right? They're just starting to think about agentic AI security and how do we treat it now

Singapore has just come out with another agentic AI security framework. So this is really a burgeoning area and if you think about where India can maybe take a stake is maybe aentic AI security. I

think India should have a big voice in this. The talent in India and I want to say this is because of our work with cyberpace the talent in India is insane. Incredible

&gt;&gt; right? So like how do we leverage this talent to really think about this unique global problem and this is the moment because we're all thinking how to approach this. Now I do want to say as a

company as a global company please do not do something different like every like the you know the worst thing is that India is doing its own thing the US is doing its own thing Singapore's doing

its own thing that's a nightmare for a global company to deal with so we also have to think about how do we collaborate globally um uh so that's my big plea to to to everybody in the

audience collaborate &gt;&gt; um but that I'll stop there thank you &gt;&gt; thank you thank you Kali and uh in fact I completely agree and not just me I'm sure everyone in the room agrees

collaboration is the way forward in a in a borderless world that we live in and also with agent coming in and we I was just in a Google uh roundt discussion where we are talking about scams frauds

we had people from across the globe discussing how the scam networks are bringing and now agentic is going to be a nightmare because so far there had been hotspots like in India we have

Jamara and other places where scams are being conducted by actual people now with agentic coming in it's all automated so and and also different set of fraud scam ransomware things that are

going to happen and what I feel is collaboration is something that is extremely important and with that I'd like to now come to uh again a dear friend uh Jay Bavisi uh founder of uh EC

council uh and basically J you sit at the intersection of cyber security policy and skill development from your global uh vantage point where do you see the biggest gap today between how fast

AI is being deployed and how prepared institution actually are to govern and secure it. Are our institution prepared to govern and secure it? So your views, &gt;&gt; thank you. Thank you very much. Uh Major

Vinit, uh glad to be here. I just wanted to put this in perspective. So I'm the guy that uh created a certified ethical hacker certification. Those of you in cyber security may have heard of it. I

want to tell you that 2001 when I created CH, there was a world that was very uncertain. Cyber security was not defined and the world was going through an entire new level of metamorphosis

where security became a new threat and there was a need. What I'm experiencing now reminds me of what I saw 25 years ago but at a completely different scale. It's insane. So let's put this in

perspective. Does anyone know how much it cost to put a human being the Apollo program? Do you know how much it costed the US NASA to put a man on moon?

$25 billion. In today's money, $250 billion US. The amount of money we're going to spend in AI this year alone is $2.6 trillion. That's 12 zeros. And that's the lower

estimate. The high estimate is $4.4 trillion. Now think of that for a second. 80 countries have already created frameworks, an AI framework. So do we have lack of framework? Not

really. Right? the the NIST EMF framework is already there. The ISO 42,0001 is there many countries like what you know we have heard from the fellow panelist it's uh it's already

there but remember before AI we already had one shortage human beings in cyber security we already have 4 million shortage of cyber security personnel we haven't come to AI yet this is humanto

human combat that we're talking about now we are layering a $2.6 6 trillion investment in technology that we really don't understand. Everyone in this room understands LLMs. We understand

hallucinations. So let's not talk about this. The question is how are we going to implement this safely? How are we going to adopt AI? How are we going to defend AI? And how are we going to

govern AI? So the simple response I have to this question is human beings will have to be the people that are going to be dealing with adoption, dealing with defense and dealing with governance.

Take a look at any organization that you know today. I can't think of one organization that I know that doesn't use AI. In fact, the data shows that 75% of most businesses already use AI.

Question, do we have governance in place? Do we think of rolling back AI after its use? Do we figure out where the data is actually permeating? No, we don't. I was at Blackhead recently. I

asked a question. I said, "We sign NDAs, right? We human beings sign non-disclosure agreements and we take your secrets and we say, "Yeah, absolutely. This is going to be a

secret. It's with me, but someone in the department is going to put this into some LLM out there." And LLM is opaque. You have no idea where your data is going. what happened to your

non-disclosure agreement? It creates a whole level of liability. I can talk about this the entire day and still not come to an end. So the point is we need to build human capability. So think of

this as a moment to the humans in the room, right? If you think that, oh my god, AI is going to take over my job. Yeah, AI is going to take over quite a lot of jobs. I was reading an article

yesterday. a major consulting firm created 25,000 new jobs &gt;&gt; for AI agents, not human beings. So yeah, will AI eat human jobs? Yeah, it will. But humans will need to now move

on to next level. So think of it like, you know, we're in a hosk carriage era and we have just build the new engine. We will now have to learn to, you know, to be able to deal with this. So the the

the simple response I have is that for a country like India major right where a tremendous amount of technical talent exists language is is strong you know you can take the uh the Indian attack

you can't take the tech out of the Indian as they say right it's a pivotal moment for India to be able to build the capable humans that are going to be able to help the world implement adopt defend

and govern AI I for the entire world. I want to end by just saying one thing. This is called the AI impact summit. AI can have two impacts, a positive or a negative impact. And what's pivotal in

the middle between the positive and negative is the human being. So we need to really speed up the development of workforce in a structured manner. Not through, you know, not through a 2minut

Instagram video, right? uh this is through governance having a workforce that's developed through a measurable systems and being a having a certified workforce that the world requires. So I

I hope that helps. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Jay. And uh I also completely agree. [applause] Uh yes, thank you. I think you're right. You passed on the mic to the right person.

That was my next question to be. But then reskilling I feel this is the time when we need to talk about those conversation because traditional jobs are going res-killing is something that

we also feel that we should focus more on that and also the positive impact of AI is something that we all should work together to kind of achieve it because AI again again I'll repeat the same line

it's a great enabler but then negativity has to be some counter with the positive use cases and the positivity that the AI brings in and with that I come to you binu In fact, and Binu, you had led a

company that actually tracks a lot of these scams, frauds, ransomware attacks and all in real time. from your point of view in threat intelligence how is AI changing the nature speed and scale of

cyber attacks that organization and when I say organization again it's all in again same thing MSMES startups academia all included actually they can actually uh why they need to actually counter

this new form and next generation of attacks and how can they actually build the cyber resilience when we talk about these volumes of attacks like Ki just mentioned about TBS of backs that are

happening DOS attacks and all that. So how can like organization be cyber resilient when you talk about the space uh space like this the agentic world and also looking forward to get your views.

&gt;&gt; No thank you Venit and I think I'll probably kick off by sharing a very personal story. So 3 years ago and by the way those who are getting annoyed it's my brother-in-law wedding so I've

got Hina in my hands so don't get distracted. &gt;&gt; We've pulled you from that wedding. &gt;&gt; It's just a faway thing. [laughter] I do it

&gt;&gt; I I you know I love it to be honest. Uh but anyway uh 3 years ago uh my chief of staff actually got a WhatsApp call which was mimicking my own voice and they were basically asking her to process certain

transaction. Now she got suspicious and she eventually figured out this was a defake call or somebody was just scamming her. Fine. 4 days ago my 8 years 8year-old son he

wrote a program defaking my own mother. So what Jay just mentioned about trillions of dollars are going into AI. This is where the real impact is coming out. It's becoming industrialized. It's

a structural change. We are seeing there's so much of sophistication, so many easy tools are available in the market now that you can literally go and try to basically break the entire

enterprise infrastructure. It's already happening. So just to give you a context on an average day we are seeing around 70 to 100,000 new defake audio calls in our systems and many of them are very

very sophisticated. In fact many of them are actually being bypassed bypassing our own algorithms to detect them. We seeing fishing emails so I'm sure since 1980s we have been talking about fishing

emails or scams coming out. We don't see those grammatical errors or odd you know characters coming on these emails anymore. We are seeing that these are like emails with all the context like

agents are going on LinkedIn understanding what people are posting about and crafting a specialized fishing email sending it to the targeted audience. Uh we actually received a

couple of them this morning, myself included, by the way. Very very targeted because people are just leaving these AI agents on the internet who are continuously learning, having an amazing

memory system and they are making the attacks more interesting. We are seeing DARPA actually organized back in the US on how you can use AI to find zero day vulnerabilities and they were pretty

successful. In fact uh one of my friend actually got second prize over there. Uh the cool part is many of these AI systems are now able to chain different vulnerabilities in different systems to

ultimately create a sophisticated mechanism to break into a enterprise software and we are seeing several evidences of happening it right now. We are also seeing that you know just to

add some humors today agents are actually hiring human beings for those who don't know. So humans are getting employed uh by the AI agents. I think we are into a very interesting AI race era

which in my humble opinion is of a a significant national security issue because as these systems are continuously learning collecting data from different enterprises even

institutions also from the academia these systems are fundamentally learning more about the entire country than anybody else and there is a fundamental issue on how you

are protecting these systems. At the moment today, AI is seen as mostly as an infrastructure layer. They're not necessarily thinking this is has to be a cognitive layer in the

enterprises and hence why the investments in terms of protecting these AI systems is still significantly lower. there are a lot of applications people are building around it and that's why

you have some amazing unicorns and companies coming up and we also as a company use a lot of you know AI native you know stack in our in our portfolio but the risk is still highly significant

we are seeing on an average I think 50 to 100 companies getting compromised where AI has played certain role in the entire attack chain could be as basic as doing some recon

to as sophisticated as writing the actual fishing email to compromise a developer account. So the the implications are significant and I don't see any any indication that this is

going to slow down anytime soon. In fact, uh we seeing that defects are becoming a lot more prominent now where it's not just about collecting some bitcoins which used to be the case 3

years ago like you know you would have a celebrity asking to transfer some bitcoin here in exchange of some you know uh kudos or applauds but today I mean we have had companies who lost

millions of dollars because somebody dialed into a meeting room and asked somebody do something like literal defic video coming on a on a zoom call or teams call asking them to

do something. So uh it's it's a structural change as far as we are looking at as a company and we are still catching up. I don't want to give anybody any false sense of assurance

that we have all the right technologies or models to be able to detect some of these advanced attacks. In fact, uh there are number of breaches which are not even known in the public domain as

of today. And I just hope that the the government and the regulators do the right thing in terms of having a transparent and responsible disclosure so that the public and the the industry

the public and the private partnerships can come up with a a clear structure framework on how we can protect the AI systems around the enterprises as well as around the governments.

&gt;&gt; That's my thank you Mu. Thank you uh for your reflection [applause] and now since we are at time I'll request uh General Pant sir if you can share your views. I don't have a

question for you sir but I would request you to share your reflection on the entire panel and then I will come back to the panel again. I'm also looking at the watch that is just ticking. So I

want you to be ready with one quick answer in 30 seconds. And the question is if you had to advise uh government, industry, academia and the civil society on one priority to improve cyber

readiness for the AIdriven systems what could it be? And uh there's a additional question and why but then if you start explaining it will take more. So I'll leave it there what it could be. So

please be prepared. I'll just do a quick uh round with your uh answer sir. Over to you sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you Vinit and good morning ladies and gentlemen boys and girls. I seem to

be the only one with white hair in this panel so it's making me feel a bit odd. &gt;&gt; I have some [laughter] but Venit I was just thinking you need to create another organization

&gt;&gt; AI piece then all the things that you've done for cyber now need to be done for AI. And what I personally feel is that in this panel of responsible AI at scale, the next two years are really

important. They are going to define the next 20 years for India because after 20 years we reach where the PM's vision of a developed India is. And in two years we have to really tackle the aspect of

creating responsible AI at scale with a number of actions on the governance front. uh India has large advantages. We have already have a digital public

infrastructure. We have the scale. We are a democracy. We have the technical talent. So, we should do a SWAT analysis and you know take off from there. Uh as far as the cyber security part is

concerned, what I am seeing is that AI is being used both for the attack as well as for the defense. In the attack, there is a MITER framework. this it's called the Atlas framework where 13

steps of the cyber attack kill chain are given in each of these steps today AI is being used and it is seeing your defensive system it is morphing itself appearing benefit and coming inside

similarly on the defense side we are finding that AI is used to now spot zero day attacks also so it it it is actually AI versus AI uh to cut it short I just made a fivepillar framework for uh

governance. The first pillar is safety. We have to be careful about risk assessment, audits and red teaming. Second is about security that is secure by design and we've been discussing

that. Third is integrity that is the quality of data and we have to cater for you know misinformation etc. Fourth is accountability in terms of transparency and oversight. And finally the

inclusiveness which is very important from uh the Indian point of view that is AI accessible for all in multilingual languages. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Thank you sir. And with

that in fact the entire discussion on the panel is done but I request all the panelists to come up with those one priority. I'll go in order but I must also acknowledge the audience in the

room. So sorry we had limited seats. So I I I we could not make arrangement for more seats but it's good to have you. &gt;&gt; Yes. And uh also we have a reflection from uh Suresh sir request you sir if

you can share a quick reflection and then we can quickly run through the priorities. So over to you sir you can. Yes sir. Thank &gt;&gt; good morning and um I'm very fortunate

and I give surprises to Venit and I get these surprises back on the scale of 100x. So, so thank you Venit you have made me more resilient. So the point I just wanted to emphasize that it has

been very fantastic discussions from the panel members and it highlights one point that one side you have tremendous opportunities like India I say $5 trillion economy but the at the level of

European Union GDP per capita India has a potential of over 70 trillion. If you look at the US, we as a country has a potential of almost the size of world economy around 130 trillion. Now the

question is that without adopting without diffusing the technologies we're not going to achieve that scale because already the others have already achieved that scale. So how do we leap frog? How

do we reach to that level? And that's where technology becomes very very important diffusion vertically horizontally in all the aspect. But the other question as pointed out by various

esteemed panelists the challenge is the security how do you manage that how do you manage that trust if people find that everything is not trustworthy the adoption the diffusion is going to be

challenges as in the beginning we couldn't use the debit card credit card because everybody was afraid of you putting that information in the internet domain so that's where the word needs to

come with the framework as rightly pointed out we have our so many frameworks all around the world. But this is another challenge. How much you regulate, how much framework you create,

whether you wants to be on the adoption side, he wants to be on the regulation side is a very very tough choice for a country like India with the fast population ways with different

understanding, different literacy level. But one thing which is very uh important I say about India is that you may be uh illiterate by the definition of normal literacy but you will be AI literate

because AI breaks down the barrier through the bjuri you are connected to French Spanish German so that's the multilingual uh capability which is coming to you so I'm sure that these

challenges these opportunities we will emerge as a superhuman being we will have super intellged igence not only AI if AI is learning from the entire enterprises entire systems we human

being have to evolve and that's why I give credit to Lan mask about the neural link hopefully we will have a chip biochip which will allow us to learn to be the same speed where the the the

models trained on trillion parameters will allow us to think so that's the positive hope I have but then we have to see that we are not biohacked by somebody else right so these are very

different challenges and we are in a very very exciting time particularly the young generation which is there for you a lot of challenges the the our generation has brought lot of challenges

for you a lot of hope for you and we need we as pointed out we need AIP otherwise it's going to be very very challenging and fragile world so thank you very much always for this

opportunity [applause] thank you sir and uh with that I also would like to acknowledge the presence of our additional director general territorial army sir uh m general assist

sir thank you sir for your extreme presence and support uh in the room sir and I request every panelist to within 30 seconds time is over so quickly start with you sub

&gt;&gt; thank you engaging discussion I think everything that needs to be said has been said we just have one ask and that's always our Santa wish list make sure that AI principles of risk

assessment move to operationalization and that is where more inclusion more consistency understanding this like the fourth dimension air water land now cyber sphere and that's where

participation and richness of intervention I'm so glad TA is here we will create more cyber champions and that's where stakeholders like yourselves are going to play a part one

very very urgent task is to not hide and not see this as shameful if you get an attack on your shop or an establishment you'll immediately file and FIR. Include this in a national database. Make it

more transparent. Make it a matter of pride that you were attacked. That means you've got something valuable and worthwhile. More collaboration, more curation, and more engagement with

stakeholders that matter. That's &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Subie. Thank you, Kie. &gt;&gt; Uh, just to reiterate, let's not repeat the mistakes of the the past. Let's

build products with security in them. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Karie. Anna &gt;&gt; so I wanted to highlight a bit uh your initiative cyberpace I think it's uh

very important to have more such initiatives that uh not focusing only on states power attack companies but on the experience of ordinary people on the ground how they perceive uh uh cyber

security digital rights and so on. So uh we support it uh and uh I think we have um a hope for uh more initiatives from global south because on international level we see that there is a

fragmentation like reimmit just uh uh showed that uh both China and United States they uh declined to sign the final declaration. So yeah we hope for UN and the initiatives from global

majority. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Now I just want to end on a positive note that uh AI will be good for humanity and international collaboration is very important.

Governance is extremely important at this stage. As I said next two years are really important for India and the rest of the world. &gt;&gt; Thank you J.

&gt;&gt; I would just say that if you're spending $2.6 trillion in a technology and you don't have humans that know how to implement it safely, you're in trouble. Start by capability development right

from the very start. Start from the primary schools, high schools, professionals and even the knowledge workers that actually using it. So I would say workforce development needs to

be the focus of the hour. Thank you. &gt;&gt; I think my final take is based upon how I started my career which was an ethical hacker or a penetration tester. So for the enterprises or any academia I think

uh red teaming which is basically trying to hack your AI infrastructure, AI models or AI assumptions or stress testing them from a security standpoint I think are going to be most

critical especially the at these early stages where we are still building up the entire security infrastructure around it. That would be my biggest recommendation for enterprises and and

governments also. &gt;&gt; Thank you Minu and thank you all the esteemed panelists. Uh we are running slightly beyond time and thank you the audience who is there uh who is present

here. Uh we have uh a kind of announcement of a white paper that's written and uh we'd request everyone to kind of uh release uh the white paper if you can give to the panelist also. Uh

it's a white paper on AI agents autonomous interaction and cyber security risk a strategic firm for us bat. So I request uh if you all can release it and it's an announcement so

you can feel free to add your pointers and all we'll do the final release later. So [applause] I'll also request the ADT officer if you

can join for the group picture you please be in touch all of Uh we will just

&gt;&gt; and we have the momento presentation please quickly. So Dr. So we start with you. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; And final point,

thank you all. Thank you so much. Very well done.
