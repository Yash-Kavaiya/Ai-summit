## 📝 Summary

This session examines infrastructure for achieving gigawatt-scale compute capacity across emerging economies. As nations transition from data generation to domestic processing, the discussion explores building industrial-scale data centers. Panelists demonstrate how advanced GPU architectures and networking, such as NVIDIA's DGX SuperPOD and Grace CPU, enable self-reliant infrastructure across regional hubs. This operationalizes the Democratizing AI Resources Chakra, demonstrating impact through increased compute capacity, reduced latency, and accelerated transformation.
