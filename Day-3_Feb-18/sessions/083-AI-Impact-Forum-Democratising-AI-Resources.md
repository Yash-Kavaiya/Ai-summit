## 📝 Transcript

infrastructure and across capital. So the way I will conduct this session is that I will first ask a generic overall macro question from each of the speakers and I request everybody to be very uh

you know short in their answers because we have many questions. I like to cover all the aspects of this. Then I will come to the talent theme how we democratize talent. Then I'll come to

the data theme. Then I'll come to the infrastructure theme and finally I'll come to the capital theme. So we'll try to cover all aspects of the AI ecosystem in a short 25 minutes conversation. So

starting the first session a macro session and it come from and starting with you as AI capabilities are expanding globally. Uh how can governments and industry work together

that you know the access to the resources they grow responsibly with security and trust which are built in from the design itself. How do you do that? That you mix growth and discipline

and safety in a same framework. How do you do that? &gt;&gt; I love this question. It's probably one that we can talk about for quite a period of time, but there's a great red

clock in the back and uh we want to move on that. So, I think the key really is, you know, in technology and in security, we talk about roots of trust. If something is built trust with trust from

the bottom up, then each layer then builds on that same joint trust. And that's really important from an AI perspective because in order for AI to be truly transformative,

it will has to touch different parts of our lives. Move at machine speed. So people need to know what data was a model trained on. Is it data that they trust? What decisions is a model making?

What is that what are the left and right boundaries of what their decisions are? And finally, particularly when we tie to agents, are those agents identities rooted in role-based access controls and

in the kinds of things that work from there? So one of the reasons I love coming to India and I find it so exciting is in many ways India has built the foundation for your question right

when you think about Aadhaar a national digital identity system when you think about DPI a system that allows the API for financial transactions and then when you build upon that with national data

like healthcare data that the government has actually curated you have the pieces of trust applications and what's the most important AI that touches live because chat bots are very interesting

But what's really interesting is healthcare in a rural village bashini that allows real-time language translation. So somebody whose native language is not English can hear an

advanced lecture in STEM and understand it real time &gt;&gt; fast enough. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Fascinating. So Google that was the strategy point of view as a

practitioner of technology who dirty their hand in uh actually coding technology. I'd like to ask from you from a compute and engineering standpoint. Uh what advances are making

AI more accessible today than what was possible even 2 years back? &gt;&gt; Um starts off with um what you want to build for what user experience and what workload because you don't want to start

building your technology and then saying go use it because then you would end up having the same kind of car running on the road. Today you find you know the variety of cars different engine

different sizes each one using it for different needs some for a vacation some to go into work some for some other reasons so heterogeneous compute is one of the key capabilities so you want to

start with what workload what user experience keep that in mind as your architecture and what I mean by heterogeneous compute is making sure that you can find a way to run it in the

most affordable compute capability with the right performance and the right power efficiency. So in this case it's XPU as in CPU, GPU and NPU. Depending on where you're deploying it, if it's all

on the training and the data center side, it's a different kind of a size and architecture. If it's an edge is something else and if it's at the hands of the end user, it's something else.

That's how we look at it. Start with workloads, start with user experience, then figure out what kind of compute you want to give in a scalable, affordable manner with open ecosystem.

&gt;&gt; Fantastic. Thank you, Kalyan. You are sitting in the mid of the AI in action, AI execution and I'm sure you are dealing with hundreds and thousands of customers in India and abroad and the

often quoted remark is in B2B space it is all pilots and PC's and not AI in production. So my question straight uh Kalan to you is what is that tipping point when enterprise decides that it's

enough of pilot now I have to go into production now what is that tipping point enterprise is looking forward to before this starts everything starts scaling up

&gt;&gt; we start with a very interesting quote someone told me many decades back God made world in seven days because he had no installed base and enterprises uh sit in a very interesting ing uh point

especially in the B2B we have for the last 30 years only added incremental systems and in a very crude way I can say we have shoved the dirt under the carpet so kept on

putting carpets kept on this thing 15 years back everyone said oh the mainframe will not exist I think 2% increase in systems hardware on mainframes is a interesting data point

saying that people are not finding better TCO on other systems. They're still sticking to this thing because the applications the data is being put into significant depth. The tipping point in

my opinion is we never built systems with data first approach. We always built applications, workflows, processes and the data was hidden behind those systems. The fundamentals of AI is that

it needs access to data independence of data. data products having better metadata definition of data and then ability to get access to LLMs or SLMs or agents to access them. The reason they

struggle to scale is your data stewardship. How do you provide access to data? It's very complex. You can't to access an employee data. You might think it's just go and query by employee ID.

There's so much layers which people have built in the systems. That's where I think orchestration, process intelligence and then finding that balance between deterministic

workflows and probabilistic that's the trick in in B2B and the tipping point. It's not to say AI is not working but it's your data which is not feeding the AI to make it work.

&gt;&gt; I think sometimes these are the hidden layers we all miss. We all are talking about models and agent but we don't think the raw element of that is data. It's all there but is accessible. It's

available in the right way, right format. I think Kalyan is giving the right tip to all of us. So let's start with our uh you know first theme specific round and that is on talent.

How do we democratize talent in this whole AI ecosystem? So my question now to Gokul first to you. Uh what are the practical approaches which will help organizations to expand AI capability

beyond some very small specialized team. You know every organization we have few people who have figured out how to deal with data, how to create models, how to fine-tune models, how to put them into

production but majority of the people are just consumers of a GPT. So how do you actually create that capability in the organizations that it is widespread in the organization and not just limited

to few people? Um this is an excellent point because u it's easier to find uh AI skill set when you're coming fresh from college because they don't have to unlearn anything but if you're already

in the industry and you work for many years there is certain amount of reinventing that has to happen. U one of the things that we actively look at is at least in the semiconductor space

being a chip designers we try to look at AI in engineering. If you're building products for AI, if you're doing computer and processors, we ourselves have to look at what it means to use it

in engineering those products. Obviously, it's not an easy thing and it's not available yet and it's an evolving space. But more importantly, like you said, rather than it in staying

in a pocket through an elitist, our goal is to make sure for each function, each role um and each capability in some way are having an extra skeleton of sorts. They walk into the campus when they

badge in, they actually feel like they've brought in another assistant with them for what they're doing. And that is primarily by having them

build or use an AI tool that will make their jobs faster, better, improved, either its efficiency or its quality. And when you have that, you have time to innovate. So that's another uh aspect

that we've been looking at where everybody is actually having some kind of an exoskeleton capability with their AI assistant based on whatever role or function that they're doing. Yeah.

U and next question to you. We all like are all uh charged up on the prospect of AI will change our lives, right? And we know AI can genuinely change our lives across the spectrum, you know, in every

field of life. But at the same time because you are putting your data into a machine and machine become intelligent and giving results, we also have a lot of inherent I would say distrust. What

is this black black box which is giving answers? What type of data has gone into this? Is my data getting misused? So the question is for a widespread adoption of AI some of the fundamental questions

will be transparency explainability uh and I think it'll be not a matter of only a technology it will always be a matter of regulation also regulation and technology working together so according

to you what all these elements of technology regulation observability explanity are required which will help build a wider confidence in you know AI adoption across the world in India

everywhere what's your take on this &gt;&gt; so Humans don't trust black boxes and we shouldn't particularly for things that touch important parts of our lives. So I think you laid out exactly beautifully

the components of the solution. Right? One part is transparency. What data is a model being trained on? Is that data to be trusted? Right? When we think about AI and education, we know we don't want

AI education things trained on social media because there's facts that we want our children trained on regarding history and culture, not just people's opinions, right? That's one good

example. The second part truly is to your point understanding the how the model arrived at the answer it did. So when we think about for example an AI model that's helping to identify how

much purifier goes into a water system right there's been data over decades of what amount goes in after a flood during a period of illness right and then there is norms of what there is if a model is

recommending something outside the norms you're going to want even more understanding of why and I think the final part of that is exactly to your point the ongoing training so people

feel like the model is also continuously adapting. The regulation is a really big piece of that because when something's really important, the fundamental incentives of the private sector are

advancement and innovation, not safety, security, and reliability. Regulation will help us do that. How we ensure it's not compliance checkbox, but rather really continuously [snorts]

evolving with benchmarks and continuously responsive to ongoing attempts to say, is the model safe? Has it been hacked? How do we know the results are okay? Will be needed.

Thank you. And so Kalyan um next question to you. I think you coming from a software background are very very familiar with this dichotomy with India face. On one side we say India has got

the largest skill and talent pool in the world but at the same time we have we say we have the shortage of the skilled talent you know we we say the same thing in the same breath you know so many

times. So according to you in this AIdriven world how can industry and academia hand work hand to hand to really make the talent available in a widespread way so that we can really

benefit from AI you know which it really deserves. So how do industry and academia work together? &gt;&gt; So see if you really roll the clock back we really were good at fulfilling

demand. So if you look at the '9s like India was always a demand fulfilling entity. So like when NIT and A tech and they really created those that then when the big

large IT services companies they had to really build many universities to really train people. I think an was pointing to the point that there's enough knowledge available

now. Correct. This these systems have gathered they have read enough. It's it's like you don't need to search for they they understand context. So I'll [clears throat] take a very simple

example. We needed demand for coders and so we built a lot of coders. There's a big difference between coding and engineers. Engineers have systems thinking. They look at problem solving.

So you need to start to pivot the whole approach. Either you go deep or you go wide. So either you build skills which are more deeper and that's where I think industry academia they'll have to start

you can't be teaching people programming languages which you're not going to use anywhere your curriculum has to go through a complete reje so that's the first thing both industry and academia

have to partner into that the second is we have to start to pick skills which we never valued persistence grit critical thinking problem solving things which you never were so serious considering in

university we're so single disciplinary we have to become multi-disiplinary people have to start to adapt and every skill can be augumented with computing skills so you have a good mechanical

engineer they could start to adapt how they can apply AI so so I would say looking at someone with a computer science background to solve all problems versus using that plus skill that dual

skill is going to become very very important that the third is learn unlearn and relearn [clears throat] is something which each individuals have to take it on their

own. You can't expect government and enterprises and others to only solve the problem. People also have to take and I think with the availability of MOO and other aspects there's enough available.

I don't think we have a issue of content. It's about how people adapt and use it. Yeah. Okay. Um so let's move to the next theme now which is the theme of data.

I'm just hoping that I'm able to complete all the themes considering the time but again let's try to do as much as we can. So coming to the theme of data and let me start with you AI by

nature means that you are creating a huge cluster of machines GPUs putting unlimited amount of data there and the machine become intelligent start giving data so it basically you are

concentrating data and resource in one place and then you'll be start serving the whole world that is one part of AI but the second part of AI is because you're putting your critical

confidential data every country says I want to be sovereign and completely self-governed and self uh you know independent to this this is a dichotomy again right So ultimately it will

require a collaboration between countries so that these capabilities of each country can be utilized and everybody's able to benefit from AI in a collaborative way. Considering that

technology and these tools are being used more like a weapons of geopolitical negotiations nowadays according to you how can countries collaborate meaningfully so that the benefit of AI

actually reaches the masses and every country is able to bring their capability forward &gt;&gt; I think it's a really excellent question and I think the key will need to be

federated data learning right so if we think about drug discovery and the ability to generate proteins that are not known to nature Right? Using models, ideally you want to

be able to test those drugs or identify on pretty much rare cancers for example, just picking an example, right? Where you have people around the world where you want to bring together that data,

but you also understand that health data, some of the most sensitive data a country has, it has to be protected and it's very reasonable for countries to expect that data stays local. So in the

United States we did pilot approaches during our department of health and human services with others around the world to say can we train models where data stays where it is and that's

possible and I think it'll be particularly important for data loads that countries are sensitive about um either from a national security perspective or a privacy perspective. So

make the tech work in order to ensure that we protect what's most important which is the core essence and sensitivity of that data. &gt;&gt; Okay. uh Ken what I will do is I'll

combine two questions into one and uh I'll cover the theme of data and infrastructure both uh you touched upon the cons the the point of data already in your previous answer but uh let me

repeat what are the foundational data architecture shifts are required for organizations to truly become a ready you touched upon that but I would like to you to talk about that again and my

second question relating to infrastructure is uh ultimately you'll have to do lots of partnerships across the ecosystem with multiple people. How do that partnerships play a role in

building a scalable AI infrastructure? So two questions in one please. &gt;&gt; Cool. The first one just I want to summarize on three key points on data. You have to start to imagine data as a

data product. So data as its own independent entity. So start if you're an enterprise start with data catalogs. Do metadata discovery. You can use techniques like knowledge graph to

really understand how data is flowing within the enterprise. You think data flows the way you designed reality on the ground. The data flows very differently and many a times that

understanding of the data and every time you want to centralize it it explodes. It goes to the edge. &gt;&gt; So centralization is a dream but it's never going to happen in the reality. I

I can quote the former Intel CEO and I was always a big fan of Pat and he used to tell me about these three things laws of physics laws of economics and laws of the land and and then that really drives

you look at the data play sometimes just latency you don't want data to be centralized there is economics cost I think and then that's a big big play and the third is data sovereignty residency

the second is lineage governance data tracking data observability because it's becoming very very important. What you teach is how the system behaves. What you feed

determines how those systems start to behave and and they learn and you there is hardly I think there are some enough research people around here who will say it's very hard to explain how these

systems work. Even the creators of the systems are not sure of how the interworkings of how these systems learn because there's a lot of it becomes so multi-layered neural networks. They're

learning very very differently. So hence it's very important that you you look at the input and the output and you keep looking at the veracity of what's what's happening and the third is build for

real world constraints and and that's what on the infrastructure the reason AI is not new it's been there for 50 years what's happened is access to hypers scale compute

&gt;&gt; has created more data which now you need more compute to process it's a very interesting cycle which we're creating &gt;&gt; and energy is going to be a big play like in your world. You're trying to

solve this problem, right? But you think you're solving the problem, but every time you try to attack it, you just you realize that you've not even scratched the surface.

&gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; So that's going to be the big big place. And that's where I think pragmatic use. Please don't use LLMs as a search engine alternative. I I'll tell people are now

using this public language models and you're going to burn like half a liter of kerosene for every query. Correct? You don't you want to build small language models. You want to optimize

infrastructure. So you cannot solve the infrastructure problem independent of the data problem. You have to think of them more holistically. So I would say we all need to become more judicious. So

the phops discipline which we had in cloud needs to come in data and compute. They have to start to understand why am I using and what and can I optimize. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Fantastic. Great insight. So

go again two questions to you two into one. the theme of infrastructure, theme of uh data and theme of capital all into one. My first question is how important it is at a system level AI

system level to bake trust and governance into the stack itself by design right even at the hardware level right you present hardware industry so I'm asking how it is to be done at a

hardware level itself and my second question is which I think globally is obviously is a controversial question how do we make sure the benefits of AI does not remain restricted to filling

the pockets of few organizations only glob globally rather the benefits of AI reaches the masses across the world. So two questions into one one technical question one controversial broadband

question please. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Were you were you saying that for the last [laughter] three in one? Um so um when when you're

looking at data clearly all aspects that Kalyan mentioned totally holds good and he talked about the security. So when we are actually u architecting the processor um security is a security

first mindset. You can't have security as a last checkpoint before you release your processor design. So when you have a security first mindset some of the things that come into mind is you know

obviously the most cliche thing is to say hey protect my data protect my model make sure that doesn't get hacked but it's also protect the user. Um so there is three aspects. So there is

application isolation so that you can give a trusted environment where the application can run. Then there is an isolation with more growing usage of AI where virtual machines have to be in a

trusted environment beyond just the application. Then the third part is if I'm going to connect multiple compute processors that connect has to also be secure. So there are tech there are

technologies for that Intel has as SGX and TDX and TDX connect but going out of all the terminology app isolation virtual machine isolation connecting different hardware pieces together all

of those have to be secure and that doesn't end there when you put all of them together you start to get something more as a confidential computing or confidential AI so that is again going

back to summarize security first mindset when you're actually architecting the chip has to come rather than at the end as a checkbox and obviously we've done that over the years and it's not easily

done. You have to have ethical hackers who are actually going to find these vulnerabilities ahead of time and that's one of the reasons why Intel processors even today are the most secure and we

are able to actually find this and also share with the industry. The second part that you asked me was around how do you make sure that u that this doesn't get how do you democratize AI uh from a

standpoint of a larger u um usage um one of the things that I which we should also be very despite all the challenges of how we got into this room and be sitting here is the fact that the AI

impact summit has brought one aspect is just the indic language translation being able to take um an English and can have that in all of our indic languages and if you have a student who wants to

learn and if majority of the content is in English they're able to uh either translate as well as transcribe and make notes out of it in all of the languages has actually broken that barrier there

are several themes in this AI impact summit one of them is just the language barrier that's gone once that is gone I think there is tremendous amount of opportunity where you've already gone a

big step in terms of democratizing. The second one is just leapfrogging in those domains where technology has not really broken in &gt;&gt; that equity hasn't come. It's still in

certain pockets where we use technology but not everywhere. Agriculture uh micro entrepreneur &gt;&gt; maybe even in education as much as we say there is technology there is still

so many of these schools that can benefit from it. You know we're still talking about 245 million students in India. That's almost the population of the United States, right? That many

students. But if you take the ratio of a PC to a to a student, every 100 student has only one. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying you need to have a PC, but and a compute device is fundamental

to learning. It doesn't matter whether you're in engineering or in any of your professional degrees. Even for humanities, that's what the national education policy talks about. I think

things like that are really going to make the capital democratization far more powerful than any infrastructure can do. Thank you. I think we can go on and on. These are the subjects which are

we can go anywhere but I have been uh constantly being threatened from the side that uh I'm taking too much of time. So we will have to end this great panel here. I am just hoping you all

enjoyed the session and you have some takeaways from this panel. Thank you so much. [applause] &gt;&gt; We do have a bonus as well. Well, I would like you all to be seated because

we have a very insightful keynote by Mr. Vishal Sika, founder and CEO of Wii and I would like to invite him here because this is also part of a session. So, it's a bonus for you all actually. Another

round of applause for us. [applause] &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. Come on. Absolutely. introduce you and kindly please take your seats. I request

all the audience and uh we are here for the keynote as well. &gt;&gt; And of course we have another very insightful panel. So I'll just make a few remarks on you

asking &gt;&gt; right. So I'm going to ask you if you want democri. So I have a few points in mind and I'll let me tell you why we are

setting up. Some of the points are about computer and infrastructure democracy, right? Why should every computer power in India and how and then data ownership Can we have a bit of order? Thank you.

And if everyone can sit down, then that helps. You want to take the empty chair? Go ahead. Take it. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. [clears throat] You want Okay. Everyone want to start.

Thank you. &gt;&gt; I'll just I'll just quickly uh thank you everyone and sorry we've sort of run into a massive huddle one after the other on the sessions. This uh session

was supposed to start with the keynote with Mr. Sikka. The topic as you all know is democratization of AI. We've finished 75 years of this democracy. But when it

comes to the pivotal moment of AI, the mood question is who owns AI? And there are many parts to AI. There's compute infrastructure, there's data modeling, there's copyright issues, there's even

talent. So there's multiple areas where democratization needs to step in. And for me the first question to you uh Dr. is AI.

Who owns AI? &gt;&gt; The um uh well we own AI of course um it &gt;&gt; when we say we you'll have to when we say we is the humanity race or is it we Indians?

&gt;&gt; The the uh that's a great question. The uh let me put it like this. what what is it? I think we have to

start with what is uh AI large language models are in a sense a compression of a large amount of knowledge. A large amount of human knowledge gets uh stored in some way. We know that it is

compressed because the size of the models even though there are enormous models it is much smaller than the size of the of the knowledge of the data. Um we also know that it is approximate

because you know they don't give exactly the answers that were inside the date but some way of approximation sometimes with hallucinations and so it is what we have built what collectively society has

built is a very powerful technology that is able to compress a vast amount of knowledge and it is able to regurgitate that in a very conversational way. You can have a authentic conversation in

Gujarati or in Bengali or in English or French or whatever. And so the question is whose data is there? Obviously you know uh companies like yourselves uh are worried about you know copyrights and

things like that. Every time we engage with AI and we give it a piece of our our lives uh we are sharing a bit of us into the AI and so in a sense it is a collective

compression of the world's knowledge. So it in some sense belongs to all of us and yet it of course belongs to a handful of frontier labs and and so on. &gt;&gt; So is it a blockchain kind of ledger

method where everyone has contributed to it so everyone owns a part of it? &gt;&gt; People are working on that on decentralized AI and various other forms of new techniques. But the popular

techniques that we have today are basically these large models which are compressions of a vast amount of &gt;&gt; of information. Uh so you know the um you are talking about 75 years of

democracy. One um we we have to create a vast vast amount of literacy with AI um in India so that a very large number of people uh more than a billion people are able to leverage this technology and are

able to thrive because of this technology. And the question comes how will we do that when we don't even have access to the large language models and things like that. And I think that um I

went back to somebody asked me this earlier today and I went back to the green revolution. One of my earliest memories is I was probably 2 years old when the war you

know that created Bangladesh happened. Uh two or maybe three something like this. And I have this memory of my parents um they were very worried about there was a ship that was bringing some

wheat from the United States and that ship was not being allowed to come to shore because of the ceasefire agreement and so they were waiting for the ceasefire to happen so that the ship

would then come into the shore and we would get wheat and my parents were genuinely worried whether we will have food to eat or not from that time and I remember when I was 19 I went to the

United States on the flight, the Air India flight to New York, the butter uh and the cheese used to be from like New Zealand or uh Holland places like that within three or four years after that

you would get Amul butter or Vijaya butter from the south and so on. So how did that happen? You know within basically within one generation in my parents' lifetime we went from this

point where a ship literally carrying gay was our ability to eat was dependent on whether the ship was going to come to shore or not to the time where we became the largest exporter of

&gt;&gt; supplier of &gt;&gt; of butter and wheat and all the we are also one of the largest suppliers of wheat now. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

&gt;&gt; So how can that happen and that if you look back at the green revolution and how we managed to produce farmers who can create these kinds of crops and create self-sufficiency. So if we can do

that, you better believe we can bring a billion people into the world of AI. So it can be done. The question is are we able to see the goals in the same way that we saw back then and are we able to

set these goals? Uh and I think that when you look at what the government is doing, it is really inspiring the um the goals that we have set. Arguably we are the leading country from the point of

view of government's involvement in AI. No other government seems to me to to me to be as far ahead on AI as our government is. &gt;&gt; This this summit is a testimony to that

&gt;&gt; the summit it's such a vast scale at which we are celebrating AI that it is really impressive. So I feel very hopeful that we can create um a very large democratized culture

&gt;&gt; where AI empowers people. &gt;&gt; I guess Dr. message is [laughter] no I I think no that that's a great

point and I think uh we we have very clearly seen that people who use AI can do amazing things people who use AI people who understand AI and its limitations and its capabilities and

build things with it are able to do extraordinary things and can we you know um my company works in this area's company works in this area. A couple of the colleagues are here. Um she has

built this app where you can have a you know people who can share their knowledge augmented by AI and share that with other people in a very authentic way. So I I feel very hopeful

&gt;&gt; right small um you know information his company's Y and I it's Vishal Wana his wife and his son also Warren so it's like triple wheel an acceleration you know we talked about democratization

of AI it starts with compute power is there a shortcut method instead of having guzzling data centers with energy water so much of energy requirement or infrastructure requirement is can AI

solve for energy requirement of its own for its own [laughter] &gt;&gt; it's a tool it is it is like your would you ask a hammer hey man can you solve your own energy problem um the uh um I

think that we have to look at it in two different ways uh one way is the situation today the situation today is AI is incredibly power hungry um you know chat GP GPT the original GPT3 based

charge GPT took something like 1.3 gawatt hours of training um so it is an um massive amount of compute and our government has been working to pro procure resources

um so far I think it's somewhere in the neighborhood of 55 60,000 GPUs that we have by the end of this year our goal is to get to 200,000 GPUs which is that is wonderful of course at the same time

OpenAI alone last year had a million GPUs Um and so it is a very difficult situation and I think we have to fight and we have to get it and which the government is doing better than pretty

much anybody else. Um and so we have to bring access to this uh we have to bring these resources and make them available to startups to people to schools things like that. [clears throat] But at the

same time um I was um yesterday you know there is a gentleman who has been assigned by you know the organizers to accompany me to different places and this poor guy was walking so much he

walked 32,000 steps yesterday and and I asked him towards the evening you know when he was so tired I said how much have you eaten and he said he um he ate two burgers the whole day and that

was Uh so you know two burgers um is about uh 30 watts of power. &gt;&gt; So when we operate on 2,000 calories in a day that's like a 100 watts like one of these light bulbs. Um and out of that

our brain is taking up 20 watts. So 20 watts your phone you know you have this four camera phone when this phone is in sleep mode that is 20 watts is less than what this phone is consuming. So that's

how our brain is working. Um our perception our what I'm speaking to you moving our hands around like this. This is all in basically &gt;&gt; multiensorial processing.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So the second way to look at it is that yeah well we have 200,000 GPUs and it is too less and all that but why don't we invent the next generation of AI which is much more power efficient

when we know it is possible. Just look at yourself. &gt;&gt; Right. One last question on talent. uh what the question is democratization of talent pool when it comes to AI people

in India are worried that should all the LLM foundational model come from there should all the talent go there we've had enough brain drain from here to us now of course thanks to Trump many of our

brains are wanting to be here [laughter] but uh you know the democratization of talent because we have huge set of GCC's today here uh some fear displacement but I remember watching your interview two

days ago to someone I don't want to name the brand but you had a very different thought of why you bothered about AI displacing talent what about AI creating many more

opportunities for this very talent to take up a new job can you help us understand what you meant there &gt;&gt; so um you know whenever new media come

um we cannot think of the new applications that are possible because of the new media. So some of you in the room are old enough to remember when television first came and we used to

literally have people who would you know read from a piece of paper sitting on television. What is the point of the television if you're going to watch a you know picture of a newsreader with a

piece of paper in their hand literally read the thing to you? You can put a picture of a person on a radio and then it is basically the same thing. But until the live events and watching

cricket matches or conferences or or having or MTV or you know when these things happen then you realize oh wow this is all the stuff that that TV can do or you know similarly on on the on

the phone that it is not just that you can have the same thing that you had in your computer now you can have in your phone but you can actually call a cab and you can get someone to for God's

sake bring Chanabura in 10 minutes and um &gt;&gt; or deliver a emergency mobile van. Yeah. Yeah, &gt;&gt; for hospitals. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; So, right now we are in a stage where we are all so panicked about what is AI going to do with all the stuff I was going to do yesterday um and the kind of work that we have

been doing so far that we are not able to see the new applications that are possible because of this and those applications are starting to emerge. You know we got a glimpse of that with this

open cloud Rama that happened um last week. Um wow you can have agent sw forms who are talking to each other and creating religions and things like this. Uh so people are beginning to wake up to

the fact that there are things that can be uh in my in my work I had a um one of my customers is in the Middle East a a distribution company they distribute things from big brands CPG companies and

one of the CPG companies decided to shut down their factory uh in one of the countries there I won't name the country um and this customer was telling me that they could use our software uh to do

analysis is and then as a result of that analysis they decided to shut down their operations in this country in one or two days of analysis you within where questions you would ask

complicated questions like what happens if the price of this goes up and that goes up here and so I asked him how long would it have taken you to do this otherwise he would say he said maybe a

year because you wait for the first quarter and you say oh things are going bad in this country why is that oh this factory shut down and the second quarter did not recover, you put some emergency

measure in third quarter because you're constantly looking backwards. Instead of one year worth of work by expensive consultants, in a few minutes you can do an analysis and take a unbelievably

complex decision like shutting down your operations in a whole country. So there are applications, wondrous applications that are possible. We just don't see them yet. And I think that this idea

that oh my god disrupt the you know that is a very backward &gt;&gt; that happened right so pre-cloud there was there were fears and that everything

will be on cloud we lose data sovereignty security we found ways &gt;&gt; and and believe me there is no doubt it is disruptive to you know stuff that we did we have seen examples of software

development happening 20 times 50 times more productively than we did before [laughter] but don't focus on what is it that it takes away focus on what is possible with this

&gt;&gt; possible tomorrow. That's a great note. You talked about television guys holding a paper. I have a screen in front of me telling me 6 minutes to go for my next panel. I'm really sorry Dr. Sika. I'll

have to end but thank you so much. &gt;&gt; And you have my dear friend Anu here you know to see I'll see you next week. &gt;&gt; Okay from Dr. Sikka and me a standing ovation to both of you all of you who

are waiting for all us. Thank you so much. Nice. We are all set for the second panel and thank you so much that you have all been a lovely audience. Guys, you can stay seated.

&gt;&gt; On the second panel today we are talking about AI for many not the few. Bridging gaps in skills, data access, tech infrastructure and capital flows. We have with ourself Mr. Mustafa Pichawala

CTO of Corsera, Anu Sharma GI, co-founder and CEO of Skyflow, Mr. Harish Sheretti, chief strategist and technology officer at Vipro. And to moderate the session, our very own Mr.

Deepak Awani, ET online editor. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um, first of all, apologies, we have very very short time. But apologies also to the next section because I'm going to steal 5 minutes from the next

session. So the warning to them if you could convey because we lost a bit of time. Uh, it's unfair on the guests that we've been waiting here. But uh this is an AI democratization uh session. We'll

if we could stick to time and take one minute only for the answer, not ramble but be clear and direct, right? Uh when it comes to democratization of AI, the first thing is compute power. Today a

lot of compute power has been resting in the western geographies while Google and various other companies have committed 67.5 billion to come to India. Do you think this will tilt the balance when it

comes to compute power for AI to in India? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I I feel like the compute power uh balance will uh democratize over time. I think it will spread over

time. So, uh I I do think what's more important is what how AI is having an impact. Um and and we can see that by how it's scaling education for example. Uh and that is happening across the

world. Even if you take India for example, the highest number of generative AI enrollments are coming from India and the access to education via AI is improving because of that and

it's democratizing all over the world by just by the fact that you know uh the AI is enabling people to access the same content in different languages and then also having support uh as well. So for

example we have something called coach where you know every learner can have a 1 is to1 personalized tutor and so that that will I think tilt the balance across the country in terms of compute

power as well. &gt;&gt; Right. Uh question for you. India has a huge database contribution to the world. We have multiple languages. We have enough data to feed the AI models.

Should we have a copyright model where we say if we are contributing say 10 million tokens then we you owe it to us that we need to have a pie in that AI for ourselves. Do you think that is

something that one can work on tech tech front or should there be a policy around it because India is going to contribute both talent as well as indic models and language English language content to the

entire AI LLMs. &gt;&gt; See first and foremost Deepak I thought you'll ask a rapid fire for all of us given the number of &gt;&gt; it seems it seems we are on a rapid fire

and I'm really sorry for this but &gt;&gt; that that's fine [laughter] that's fine. So coming back to your question uh I would say what uh what Mr. Sika talked about AI is a method of abstracting real

knowledge into a model and different sizes of model fit different needs. So at some point in time while today data is the most important thing for building models at some point in time models will

take over the role of data because you have already captured the juice out of the data into the models. So again coming back the ownership of data is very very important for the next short

time period before which the ownership of the model becomes more important. &gt;&gt; Right. Uh Asha question for you open source versus closed AI while open source you know lowers the

barrier to entry but uh does it still leave a loophole I mean you work in the cyber security area do you think open source still has to give an assurance uh to large corporates that hey don't worry

your data is impregnable &gt;&gt; so it's like your first question to Vishal uh who's B the quest in your question who is they right so when you say open source should give a commitment

right you don't know who's creating this right so open source by definition means anybody can contribute which means there is no they they so you cannot even if everybody agreed there's no mechanism

for that so I think the way to make all of this work is going to be [snorts] at the layer at which you're actually using these systems There's literally no way for me to make sure whether it's by the

way open source or closed source, right? How do you get Enthropic or Mistral to tell you that the data they have about you know economic times is actually scraped from economic times. Maybe they

picked it up from a competitor right &gt;&gt; I can tell you lots of other sites are scraping from ET but &gt;&gt; exactly my point. &gt;&gt; Good luck to them.

&gt;&gt; Exactly my point. So all the scraping is uncontrolled. So it's sort of like the way this whole thing works is the models themselves don't know when it's scraping something how much of that is going to

end up in the model right you know kit this is like kirki kiriki kit right so if you think about neural networks it's basically layers of kit and by the time it comes to you to eat

there is literally no way for you to actually figure out where this came from right. So the what are we going to do? What we have to do as enterprises or consumers is we have to do enforcement

of policy data privacy security at the time of use. That's the only way we can make all of this work and we've done this before you know frankly like even in the database world you don't really

control. You have to do all of this work at the time of use and that's going to be the case here. &gt;&gt; U coming to you this is about uh democratization of talent. While

everyone's worried about frontier models being you know baked in the valley we have our own problems to solve. There are tier one cities Bombay, Delhi, Bangalore and then there are tier 2,

tier three, tier four. Talent does not need to be bound to a geography. How does one democratize the access to AI tools so that the talent base across the nation is able to build

frontier models if required? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think first is just making sure everyone has access to the tools. But I think more importantly it's going to be important that they are trained well to

use those tools really well. Right. And for that I think &gt;&gt; so not just access train them first to use. &gt;&gt; Yes.

&gt;&gt; Because that will that will help the talent be successful. Um and and that training needs to be function specific right so every function has needs a a very specific training on how to use

there's some basic training which is AI fluency but then every function needs to have a skills track on like for my function for my role what are the skills that I need to learn and then it's also

important to be able to verify those skills so that you know you have a feedback loop of skills verification and skills training &gt;&gt; right um on governance and power control

we are at India care summit government of India is putting huge amount of effort to a build awareness get people to talk to each other at across different geographies even different

countries are here you think the government has a role to play when it comes to power concentration on who controls AI &gt;&gt; see some don't fair this is off the

record if you want &gt;&gt; that yeah it's it's a fair question and let me try to answer it uh the point that I would say is anytime there's scarcity there's There's always a

anytime there's scarcity there's always element of governance that has to step in and governments do step in to actually try to make this a fair process for everyone. Now coming to the second

element of it in terms of the policy framework a policy framework that actually focus on uh basically reducing friction in EI is more important than a compliance check from a policy

perspective. Right? That's what I would broadly call it out. &gt;&gt; Great. I love this panel. They're quick, they're short, they're brief. Thank you for sticking up. It says time's up but

it's not up for me as yet. One last question to you Ashu. Data ownership and value creation we contribute to a large extent across AI data stacks. When it comes to

putting a value to the to it is there a method that you attribute to it? You create your own solutions on cyber security. Is there a tokenization method or any other method of value attribution

to what you create? What is your IP? Because any random kid with an AI tool or a bot will come and possibly steal your own IP. How does one attribute value to it?

&gt;&gt; Sure. So, you know, we are obviously in the business of protecting enterprise data in the context of AI. But let me answer your question not in just the sky flow context but actually in the context

you asked broadly. So you studied economics. &gt;&gt; I studied journalism and chemistry. &gt;&gt; Okay. Take care. Let me give you an economics lecture. So do you know about

this Nobel Prize that went to these people on the economy of ideas. Basically here's what happened. These guys Oh yeah, bad chhatu. Uh

&gt;&gt; tandak as they say in Delhi. Put uh so this is very interesting huh so basically what they proved these uh people key think of any intellectual property you create the people who

actually create it actually get almost no value out of it okay let me give you an example uh Vishal who's a friend he was talking about this green thing I don't know how many of people know here

but the green revolution was initially started by one doctor in the US who created did a genetically modified version of wheat and rice. Now how zero people in America are eating that wheat

or rice but people in Vietnam and India and China are actually eating a lot. So you have to think about I AI the same way actually that's how all technology works

right the value is captured not by the creator but the value is actually captured by the people who are using it. So if I have an iPhone, you have an iPhone, and you're just watching Tik Tok

and I'm creating a new startup, I've captured value. So in a way, it's actually very democratic. Everybody's going to more or less get access to the same models. TK,

somebody's going to have one version higher, one version lower, but the beauty of this whole thing is it's kind of like rice and wheat. The person who knows how to cook with it

the best is going to derive value. So we shouldn't obsess about m data say this guy created a model so how do I get 25 cents back India with its billion people if all

billion people start using AI on their phones to just do basic things like when you fall sick ask it if you're running a small business find out key what should your price be you can extract the value

with a billion devices in our phones way more than the 20 million people living in Australia or UK K can so it's actually entirely in our hands to extract all the value of the models

&gt;&gt; right you talked of rapid fire final round rapid fire &gt;&gt; one word or one line at best how much time you think will India take to create its own native frontier LLM

&gt;&gt; I think it'll take a year &gt;&gt; it'll take a year &gt;&gt; your guess if you want to take the same question &gt;&gt; depends on India's mindset it can be now

or it can be a mindset like like Vish said brains multiple brains all right your answer well I'm good friends with the Vive Ragavan and all these servum people so why would we

start with zero when we can distill the models that other people are producing same thing we're going to create the filtered version of it suji server is our suji

and someone is going to make halwa here &gt;&gt; great we have halwa puri for lunch today. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you ladies and gentlemen and sorry to the next session if at all we stole

something from you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you so I offered a billion dollar.
