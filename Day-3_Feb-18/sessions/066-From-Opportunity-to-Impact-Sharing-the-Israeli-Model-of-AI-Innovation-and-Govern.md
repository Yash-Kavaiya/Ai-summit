## 📝 Transcript

my honor to invite his excellency Mr. Ruven Azar ambassy ambassador of Israel to India to deliver the opening remarks. [applause] Uh thank you Arpita. Good morning

everybody. It's really a great pleasure to be here. I want to thank uh all my colleagues that came from Israel all the way uh to honor us with their presence. We have here the people that stand in

the forefront of the Israeli effort on AI. I want to thank of course the embassy of Israel for organizing this especially Maya and all the team. Thank you very much.

Um India and Israel trust each other because we have built this partnership for the last 30 years and we have together developed the capabilities that

allow us to face the challenges of today. the security challenges we have. But we have many other challenges because we are two old civilizations that are that have established their

uh young states and are lagging behind in building infrastructure and giving all the our our citizens the opportunity to uh flourish and to develop what they need in order to be part of modern life.

And uh there's no uh other challenge than the challenge of AI that is going basically to give us the opportunity to harness all the knowledge that humanity has gathered and uh our challenge is to

make it accessible to each and every citizen each and every entrepreneur. Um so we want to hear a little bit today with from our participants here uh how they're going to do it because this is

something that is new for everybody and we want to make sure that we would be able to uh build the capability and create the the access that we need so we can together

continue to flourish and to develop new projects. that will make sure that we face also the challenges of the future. Okay. So, I'd like to thank you very much for being here and uh you will you

will invite the next speaker. That's great. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you ambassador for your valuable insights. Now, our next speaker will take us into the strategic core of

Israel's AI journey. Please join me in welcoming Brigadia General Reserve Eres Ascal, head of the AI Directorate at the Prime Minister's Office. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Ambassador, and thank you for

the organizers. I'm very glad to be here in this stage. Um Iask the head of the new AI directorate under the prime minister before I retired from the military as a head of the digital

transformation and AI of the IDF all over the world and we established the our directorate under the prime minister because in Israel we are we believe that AI it's a issue of cyber sec of national

security and it's going to change all our life of course. So um we want to lead Israel, we have two main goals. First to lead Israel to be among the top three of the world in this

field and we're going to be there. And the second is to improve the quality of life of every Israeli citizens and our allies like India of course. And how we going to do it? We going to use our

competitive advantage. I believe that Israel we are the best in the world to to solve the real life problems and because that we're going to build

three domains. First as I said labs of real life solutions with academia with the industry all the guys here and we're going to find 50 verticals and to solve them. The second is to use our strongs

in cyber security cyber security for AI safe foundational models etc. And the third is uh edge solutions. We believe that if we want to implement AI in the edge or in

the real life, we must to build something in the edge, not to trust data centers in 100 kilometer from us. We want something local in the surgery room, in the classroom or in the border

or drones. So the idea is to use our industry from the from the military from the ind civil industry and to build it together. I want to invite you all to be part of

that. India they are a good friend of us of course and they believe that we can't do it alone. We need to build it together. All the big countries Israel and India of course. Thank you very

much. And uh we're going to show you our products but just we have a lot of companies and lot of product in just the beginning like I said. Thank you. [applause]

&gt;&gt; Thank you General Askeel. Now I invite Dr. Dr. Victor Alanes, senior research scientist and head of the center of AI in Agriculture at the Volcani Institute, Ministry of Agriculture.

&gt;&gt; Thank you and thank you for being here. Thank you, sir, for having us here. Um it's a great opportunity to give you in a few minutes uh our vision about using AI in

agriculture. I come from the research the volcanic center. It's the research arm of the ministry of agriculture. Uh we deal with all aspects of agriculture including uh the um AI and technologies.

So our um mission is uh to feed the world to feed the world in the future with exponentially growing population uh the and at the same time do not ex do not exhaust the the um our planet planet

earth. So we would like to have uh both sustainability of the agriculture and also prod produce enough food for everybody. The common and the conventional way to to do it is uh to

maintain sustainability is to reduce the the inputs. Reduce chemicals, reduce fertilizers, do not pollute. On the other hand, this reduces the yields and the feeding the world it won't be

possible. So the there is a kind of contradiction of whether we can use a high technology in order to solve this problem and uh we think that uh the sustainability of agriculture is not

necessarily does not necessarily go together with reducing um of the use of technology. the other way around. Technology today can help us solve problems and do things more efficiently

that we did once. So uh we can use uh tools like AI in order to uh do precision agriculture, digital agriculture, find where are the uh specific points where we can uh use

those advanced technologies, the specific points and uh and local areas that we can fertilize where the need is most prominent where we have to um to use herbicides and pesticides.

and in a very early stage we can detect it. So AI today gives us the tools to do that. Uh we can do it by um um having a lot of data acquired in pests diseases and decide when is the best time to

use those uh chemicals. uh then we can uh centralize and use the knowledge which is today only in the farmer's head and sometimes in the advisor's head and to make it available to all the farmers

all over the country all over the world and uh last but least not least is to use digital twins models. uh just to give you an example of what uh we are trying to do. Uh we use of

course all the modern and uh state-of-the-art tools of deep learning and computer vision just to detect very early weeds in the field h diseases in the leaves or pests and decide when is

the best time to act. uh we use all the we want to use all the LLMs the large language models that are specific for agriculture that do not really exist today not only because nobody has

trained them but also that the knowledge that those models have to be trained from is not available in a written form sometimes it's just is experience of farmers and we have to collect it and

put it in the LLMs and the digital twins is enables us to make simulations but not just simple simulations but spial and simulations with various

kind of conditions that will find the optimal the optimal conditions to um grow the the crops in each one of the places. Um speaking of AI tools is not only in

the implementation of the trivial or known things but also in genomics genomics and phenomics. We can use AI tools to go and through the phenotyping of crops, find how the genes are

connected to how to the phenotype that means how the the plants grow and find the best types and varieties that they are resilient to the specific conditions

that the the crop is grown. This is spec specifically um important for the current situation where climate change makes the um climatic conditions very different than they were once. So how we

do it in Bulcani? We have established a center which is a a national center in Israel that uh brings everything together brings the biological infrastructure of genomics and all the

omics together with the sensing and the AI tools uh in the algorithm part and also a computational center where all this can be implemented. So uh research is ongoing in order to find what are the

best tools in the AI that bridge all of them together. But of course this is not enough. In order to get um in the innovation to impact, we have to go through some barriers that they are

really known from from other um from other topics as well. But also in agriculture, the legal, the social societal and the financial barrier are have to be

overcome in order to have an impact. And as have been also told a lot in this conference before, the trust of the farmers is a difficult part that has to be gained in order to have a great

impact. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Victor for sharing how AI is shaping a more sustainable future. Now moving on, AI is not only transforming industries, it is reshaping

how we educate the next generation. And to discuss the same, please welcome Miss Mira Zarvib, Deputy Director General for Innovation and Technology at the Ministry of Education.

Hello everyone. Thank you ambassador for the opportunity to present here in India the education system in Israel and how we implement AI in the Israeli education system. Thank you for being part of the

Israeli delegation. And my name is Mav Zib. I'm the deputy director general for innovation and technology. And I'm honored to be here with you today.

I'm going to give you only a brief glimpse of what we're doing in the Israeli Ministry of Education uh in order to implement AI in the education system. I'll start with our vision. Then

I will present our four pillars in the strategic Israeli strategic plan. Then I will give an example of how we implement AI into the system. I will elaborate on the 720

personalization pro project and I will talk about our sandboxes and of course we will talk about collaboration. Okay. So let's start. I will read out loud our vision. Our

vision is to promote flourishing at every level, individual, community and the nation. Our education system will provide personalization to drive students and teachers growth across all

dimensions of life. And now to to our strategic plan. Our strategic plan is based on four main pillars which are aligned with the Oxford AI readiness and of course to

this amazing conference uh principles. Um the four pillars are human capital, infrastructure, regulation and innovation. Okay. So let's dive into that human capital.

The human capital pillad uh is I would like to present the competency tonomy. This is a framework we developed in Israel of how to promote AI competency from the basic level to

the topest level. So as you can see in Israel we have only 2.3 million students not more than that. Uh we have basic AI competency for all. I will give an example how we gained uh this goal and

the next level is AI in subject areas. We integrated AI into different subject areas. What's unique about these two steps is that uh this is how students use AI. In

the next three layers, we have erh students learning how AI is built from the basic level AI and STEM to the highest level. Our 1500 students learning as AI scientists how to build

the future LLM, Israeli LLM for the future of Israel. of course with in alignment to what errors has just presented. Um I will have the video just

behind me. What I would like to say that as you can see in the picture we have every year a year a month of AI. What's very unique in this month that in only one month

more than 70% of the students in Israel gain the AI competency. We used it in a very special approach integrating a top down and bottom up approach and competitions, hackathons. You can see

the curious faces and the happy faces of the students. uh we we understood that if we want to implement AI into the curriculum, we should do it in a really different uh ways.

Now to the next pillar, infrastructure in Israel from the fourth grade, every student can use a special bot uh that we developed in the Ministry of Education, a special bot that teaches AI. This is a

Q2 bot. Then next to the seventh to the 12th graders, we have the notebook and Gemini. Every student has an access to these tools. And then we have our

amazing 7 and 20 project that I'm going to present to you today. So seven the seven and the 720 project is a personalized we're talking about a personalized system. We are going to

talk about four version of uh personalized systems. In every system, student, teachers and principles has their own AI agents. The agents are connected. So everything is

personalized. We are talking about a unified holistic system that every school can use. I will talk about the sandboxes later and how we mitigated the risks. Okay. So let's see it in the uh

video that we have here. &gt;&gt; Sound enters a 30 The vision is clear. The technology is in place. Now, let's see how the system

works in practice. The student enters a 360° learning environment where everything about their school experience lives in one place. Learning, attendance, progress, mentoring, and

goals. &gt;&gt; Together, this creates a complete picture of each student, enabling personalized learning and meaningful growth. The experience begins with a

short personal onboarding. Students share their interests, their goals, and how they prefer to learn. Meet Maya. She wants to move to a more advanced class in science. She learns best through

visuals. Based on this, the system builds her a learning path, not a fixed curriculum, but one that responds as she progresses. From Mia's point of view, learning feels

clear and active. She moves forward, explores, and receives support exactly when she needs it. As Mia learns, the system quietly adapts with her, helping surface patterns, strengths, and

challenges early before they become obstacles. Leaders see the full picture. Learning pathways across grades, usage, and engagement, teacher development,

metriculation predictions based on live data. This is 720 vision. 360° of the student and 360° of educator support. All connected in one system. We believe that when

learning is personalized, potential is unlocked. When every child feels seen, valued, and empowered, education transforms into a journey of growth and discovery. And together, shaping a

better future for thousands of children who deserve nothing less. Okay, as I said only a glimpse you didn't see the whole video about how we personalize this to the to the teachers experience

but there's time that the clock is ticking now to the uh the final pillar regulation in order to promote all these tools we had to move from frameworks to national scales and we did it in a in a

very special erh framework frameworks that we built to regul regulatory sandboxes. We we started by setting risk framework with multistakeholder committee the defined risks set new

sandboxes rules. Then we worked together the ministry, industry, local authorities, teachers and we co-run together experiments. Then we monitor, measure and learn from real classroom

data, set new evidence-based regulation and scaled up. This is an example of the Cubat. How we h set the risk categories from technological uh problems, pedagogical, professional identity, the

risk level, what is the the result of the ski the the risk and how we mitigate uh the risks. And now finally, I know I have only 10 seconds uh the Jerusalem declarations.

Two weeks ago, there was a preconference to this conference, our conference in Israel. And uh we're here as as I said before to strengthen the Israel India cooperation in AI and STEM education.

And in our erh conference, we had the Jerusalem declaration that was adopted by 15 countries at education 20236 that reflects a shared commitment to integrate AI and education and to scale

success through international collaboration. Will India be the 16th? Okay. Thank you. [applause] Thank you Miss Zarviv for this wonderful

presentation and explaining it so well. AI is redefining the labor market globally in Israel. It is seen as a strategic engine for growth. It is my pleasure to introduce Miss Inbal Mash,

director general of the Israeli employment service to ste speak about how AI supports nationwide workforce adaptation and strengthens Israel's innovationdriven economy. Miss Mash

Good morning all. I'm honored to be here in h your beautiful country. This is my first time in India. So I'm very excited to be here. Shalom and namaste.

When we speak about AI and the future of work, many countries speak in terms of dis disruptions. Israeli speaks in terms of design. For us, the response to AI is not a reactive response to technological

change. It is strategic engine which we expand innovation across the entire labor market. True to our identity as a startup nation, Israel strength has always been scale.

It has been speed, dynasty, talent and ecosystem alignment. Today the strength is clearly visible in our AI adoption patterns. Just a minute.

Okay. According to the innovation authority, 95% to the of 19 95% of high-tech employees in Israel

use generation and it tools very regularly compared to only 18% across other sectors. But the story of AI in Israel is not same for all. Israel

is strong in AI but adoption is not equal across the economy. When we analyzed almost two million job seekers, we see a clear and systematic guardians. Core urban areas show high exposure to

AI in the geographic periphery. It drops in the socioeconomic periphery. It decline further and in the double periphery exposure and

effective use of language and image model tools can follow can fall below the national baseline. This is not anecdotal. It reflects human capital spread, firm

capabilities and access to training and employers. It is not technological gap. It is sectoral labor market. Just a minute,

it's not working. sectoral labor market challenges and this exactly where public policy must intervene. Israel approach in in a therefore

comprehensive. We treat AI not as a sectoral innovation but as a future of work infrastructure challenges. Our national strategy operates on a multi-level pathways.

First, basic AI exposure at scale, safe and productive use of language and image tools for every worker and job seekers. Second, workflow integration

embedding AI into processes, templates, quality checks, knowledge bases, automation with governance and result tracking. Third,

advanced tools, upskilling and reskilling into data automation, operating operation, AI systems, AI security and product rules that are directly job linked. First,

advanced and sectoral models, domain specific applications in health, finance, industries and public services deployed in secure in in environment. But adoption alone is not enough. The

labor market is becoming more dynamic. Occupational transition are accelerating, skill scales are shortening. We more and more frame training as

ongoing support. Model learning, microcourses, regular review and employer linked pathways that close a clear loop between skills signals and job outcomes.

In this ecosystem, the Israeli Public Employment Service plays a central role. We position ourself not only as a placement agency, but as a bridge across the changing labor market.

We connect four domains at scale. One, job seekers. two occupations and skills. Three, employers first and training system in Israel. Israel model is built on a

simple principle. Innovation must move beyond the core. The first of our work is not something that happens to us. It is something we need to make happen.

As a startup nation, we know how to build technologics. Now we are focused on translating technological strait into a broad base capabilities including in the double

This is how AI becomes not only innovation story but a national growth strategy. I think that Israel and India both are the future. Thank you all. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Miss Pash. Now, please join

me in welcoming Dr. Victor Israel Gosselka, head of the Horizon Line division, who will share how AI is reshaping scientific research methodologies and what this means for

the future of discovery. Hello to everyone. Thank you to having me here today. Okay. During the past several decades, we see

more and more researchers to to work just to stay in the same rate of progress in the in science and stay in the same rate. You can see it in the in the graph here behind me

regarding the the more law, but it's it's the same in other fields of science. Uh we the name There there is definition to to to this phenomena. The name is the scientist productivity

paradox. When we speaking about the AI and science there is three perspective or three different ways to to look at it. one is is to to understand the impact of

AI on AI science impact of AI on the society economy and ethics and other things in the life. The second way to to to understand the the relationship between the AI and the science is to to

discover how to enhancement the art artificial intelligence itself. And the third one is the what I'm focusing my presentation it's how I we can use the AI to advance

the the the science uh as you can see in uh in the slide behind me that I bring a change in the way we are doing the science the scope of the change is re revolutionary

it's the same like the microscope discovery or the the telescope or computer and their implication in the in the science. Uh this is my main slide that explains

that AI change every aspect or any part of the process of science process from uh genetic generating the hypothesis uh through the literature synthesis to the doing the experiments

itself. um the tools for uh for doing all this chest is already there copilot prism alpha fold and so on. uh so you just need to take the the all this those

tools and implement it in the AI in science and uh we think that the future of science not just it's not just using AI as a tools

it's not tools it's co-scientist it's named already there it's work like you're in with other partners or other scientists it's not just another tools like computer or Microsoft telescope

that's that's as I mentioned it's a revolutionary in in paradigm of of of science so in the in the Israel ministry of

innovation science and technology uh we set a goal to advance the scientific parad by developing and implementing the capabilities specially really dedicated to science and that's the way we are we

are working to resolving the productivity products that I mentioned in my in the first slide and we are looking for the collaboration with India uh because we are we believe that

together we can go to the future of science uh by using those tools and and find discoveries new discoveries in science. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; [applause]

&gt;&gt; So part of us are leaving but please stay and uh continue enjoying our presentations. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Gustalkka. &gt;&gt; Oh

finally no AI ecosystem can thrive without strong industry leadership. Now join me in welcoming Mr. Anne Villan, Chief Operating Officer of AI21, who will speak about how Israel's AI

industry alongside multinational R&amp;D centers sets global standards and strengthens collaboration between academia, startups, and government. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh I'm going to still uh

inval shalom and namaste. Um, thank you, uh, Ambassador Arez and, uh, the Israeli embassy here for organizing this event. Um, I'm very honored to

represent the Israeli, uh, industry in this panel. How do I turn this? Because you know what they say? They say that it takes a village to raise a raise

a child. It takes an ecosystem to raise a global AI leader. In Israel, we see ourselves as a global AI leader. We have the government, we have the academia and we

have obviously the industry. The government provides our infrastructure, our roads, our electricity to for our village. Academia is our school is our base, our intellectual basis to build

the uh um build our village to raise our village. But the industry the industry is the home is the heart of where the raising of the ecosystem happens. And um Israel is one of the only nations

in the world that actually uh possesses the whole AI stack and our ability our ability to control all the layers of the stack which I will go into in a second is what uh makes us resilient, strong

and um innovative in uh pushing this uh uh this forward. So let's go into details. On the bottom layer we have the foundation. So we don't have huge uh um infrastructure like other countries but

we do see the infrastructure layer as a very important basis for everything that we do. We need to make sure that we have enough sovereign compute power for our uh sustainable uh um selfuse as well as

to support our research, our scientists, our innovators. um that they have all the GPUs that they that they need to uh develop their uh uh innovations.

Next layer is the muscle. It's where we build the hardware of uh the AI uh hardware chip design. This is uh Israel is the home of one of the uh some of the leaders in uh AI chip uh design. Uh some

hardware manufacturing edge AI companies like uh Havana Labs and Halo um are companies that are focused on on this layer. Next level is the brain is the um software infrastructure for AI. This is

uh companies like ourselves like AI21. Uh at AI21, we build uh LLMs. We're the Israeli LLM. We build foundation models. We build agent orchestration platform built for accuracy for scale

uh and uh to make sure that uh we target the missionritical applications because AI is right now at the just at the beginning of the adoption curve and one of the key uh challenges for the entire

industry not not just in Israel would uh would be to create the trustworthiness of the AI solutions. So the AIS could could deliver accurate uh uh relevant and timely results and

all these layers are actually what drive the uh most important layer which is the value and this is what my colleagues have discussed today. uh it's where the uh applications and real real world

solutions across all of the critical uh pillars we've discussed today agriculture, education, employment, science, um future of work. So all of these uh layers are built on top of the

foundations uh below. uh and in Israel we were famous as the uh the startup nation and we're really good at solving real world problems and we have a lot of companies working with the government to

solve these problems built on top of this stack. So how what does our ecosystem look like? So we have four major players in our ecosystem. On top we have the

regulators. They they define the direction they set the policy. uh they block they they sorry they remove they don't block they remove uh uh regulatory blockages hopefully

uh and that they are they are the basis for for for what what we do uh on the right side we have the academia AI is a knowledgebased uh uh industry we must have very strong academia that will

raise our next generation of researchers of developers that build uh everything. On the left hand side is um actually the the private sector, the operators and the public sector. So the people who are

consuming AI inside of Israel in uh in the past Israel's uh uh economy or Israel startups used to uh try to go to the US or to uh Europe and what we've seen in recent years which is very

interesting that we are focusing now on local market. Israel is it's on its way to become a trillion dollar economy and we see that our partners both in the public sector as well as the public as

well as the private sector are actually the best design partners that we could ask for. They are demanding they're you know taking uh uh uh us to the limit but this is what actually

enables us to take and build this technology and then spread it to the world. And at the heart we have the uh um the Israeli industry. So it's a combination of local startups. You see

some of the logos here. I didn't have enough room. I would need probably three slides to put the entire industry. And we have the multinationals. So we have huge R&amp;D centers of all the big players.

Microsoft, Google, Nvidia. Just in the last uh uh CES in January, Jensen uh uh the CEO of Nvidia mentioned that uh in one of the core uh um AI projects of Nvidia, four out of the six chips were

developed in Israel. uh so uh they're doubling down and there's a lot of investment going on in in uh multinational R&amp;D uh centers and this creates these core uh AI technology

companies create a spillover effect because uh uh our company we're about 250 people uh about 150 of them are scientists already five startups have spun out of our company so the people

who work at these core companies go and build the companies that are uh all over the stack that I mentioned mentioned before. So to conclude um

our vision that Israel would go from the startup nation to the AI nation. In Israel we are famous uh in dealing with uncertainty. Uh uh oh boy, we've had a lot of uncertainty the last few years.

But uncertainty builds resilience and our strength is in our ability to work through uncertainty with our resilience and uh to build sustainable company that would power the international AI

infrastructure. We're not after the hype cycle. We're after the impact cycle. And this is what we do. We invite everybody to join our village. Not just as visitors or our as users of our

technology, but to help us build and expand our ecosystem to a n to to an international ecosystem because what we build can uh benefit with cooperation with India with the rest of the region

with the rest of the world because everything that we do is becoming global. Thank you very much. [applause] Thank you Mr. Villain. Now I invite Mr. Yol Ben or who is director of digital

health from the ministry of health. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. So thank you for having me. My name is Elanor. I'm from the Ministry of Health uh from the digital health uh

division. I will try in the really few minutes I have just to talk about our strategy in the past two years. Every slide here can take a one hour a couple of hours of presentation

but feel free to connect me afterwards if you're interested in one of the subject uh uh more deeply. Uh so let's uh let's start. Uh so first what we're trying to achieve in health I think we

have two main goals here. One is to redefine healthcare services not just adding AI to current service models. So we want to uh to to uh create impact. We need to really change the way we deliver

care. The second I think is the growth engine which in Israel we like to see the healthcare services not just as an expenditure but as said just before seeing as investment in creating a

powerhouse for companies to expand globally. So this is a win-win situation between tackling our health challenges and a global expansions to to powerhouse of AI companies. So this is the vision.

How are we planning to get there? So we have three pillars in our strategies. Uh one is obviously data regulation and transformation. So I'll talk really briefly about each one of them. Uh data.

So we started in Israel very early to digitalize about 30 years ago. We have a lot of data. Healthcare is a datadriven industry. But because we started early, this industry is working with silos.

There was no regulation at the at the time we began. And currently in Israel, there's a big project called the health data portability law. Working very hard to standardize the data to being much

more inter interoperable and uh and navigating and helping data to to flow from to to every point of care. And obviously this is uh this is the first step for AI revolution, right? If you

don't get the all the relevant data at the point of care, uh you you cannot do anything. So this is something that it's a big project. It's infrastructure project. Nobody likes to do

infrastructure projects. People like to do the value thing the value side of things but you have to start with it and uh there's a lot of lesson to be learned how to how to scale this infrastructure

project. Uh that would be great to share if anyone is more interested. Second is AI regulation. Uh so we're seeing a big shift from uh regulating the products to uh risk management that

is being done by health organizations. Uh if once we as a small country looked at the FDA or the CA the global uh regulators of software as medical device and we said okay they approved it now we

can just implement it in Israel or in India and many other places. Uh today AI became a platform. uh there is no regulator in the world who can regulate every AI agent that will be implemented

in every healthare system. That is not a sustainable approach. Therefore, risk should be managed by the health organization themselves. And this carry a lot of responsibility of health

organization. Uh they're coming back to ask us well it's great that you're give giving us the responsibility now we can run fast but how are we going to do it? Please advise us please guide us. So

we're working very closely with health organization in Israel to uh building the AI governance for health organization. How they how can they manage the risk by themselves and of

course we are government will be accountable for uh putting these processes in place in each of every health organization. Uh so this is the second pillar. The third is is

transformation. We want to see the impact of this data and governance of of the data uh infrastructure and the governance infrastructure. And here there's a lot of use cases going on in

Israel. But I just want to uh talk about how we we separate between two main themes. One is I call them the obvious but complex use case. If it's obvious and not complex then it's not interested

from the government perspective. There's a lot of obvious use cases that are not complex but there and I just wanted to give you two examples. One is um obviously most

discharge summaries uh going out of the hospitals in two three years. We would not think that physician would write them by themselves. Maybe they will go over them but we of this is technology

that already exists. Uh uh but to deploy it in scale in every health organization is very very complex. It's there's a lot of regulatory issues, uh, accountability issues. So, this is like what I call the

obvious but complex use cases. We see very high impact. Uh, the technology is always is already there and now the the question is how you can scale them. Um, maybe another example of these kind of

projects. Um, um, the possibility of a physician to commun communicate with uh, uh, clinical guidelines. You want it every every take every place the physician meets a patient, we want them

to be able on the context of this specific patient with the relevant data to be able to uh to consult uh to have a consult consultancy with an LLM that reads all the uh academic research that

is relevant to this patient. This is also a technology that is already in place in many sectors but putting it in large scale in every hospital in Israel or India, it's a very complex uh but

obvious use case. this is something that we should do. The moonshot projects are are also very interesting and this is I think a different mindset and different approach. How can government uh uh

should t tackle them is uh working on things that are uh more riskier uh but with more more impact and this maybe I'll give an example um do we really need a physician to write every uh

prescription uh or maybe if someone is a chronic disease is a chronic patient and he wants to renew every three months he renews his prescription Israel

So maybe you don't need every time a physician to write it. So these are a much riskier projects and and we now currently building a regulatory sandbox for for these uh new new kinds of

projects. With this I just want to finish uh so as we all said we're just in the beginning collaboration sharing and learning from the mistake of each other is is the way to succeed. So happy

to to be here and thank you very much. Sir, &gt;&gt; thank you Mr. Yo. Now for the closing remarks, I would like to invite Mr. Fares Sai, Deputy Chief of Mission at
