## 📝 Transcript

As protocol, I know we need to get a picture first. So, as speakers, we'll get the picture and then we'll get started right away. Great. Without further ado, we'll get

started. Uh we have the honor as I said of having Shri Bhuti Raj Khari who is an IAS officer of the 1992 batch from the state of Andhra Pradesh. Uh he holds he's special chief secretary that covers

agriculture, animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries and we have the honor of having him deliver the keynote address. Sir, I welcome you to kindly deliver the keynote address because Andhra Pradesh

truly is leading the way in a lot of the thinking around technology and agriculture. With that, over to you, sir. Thank you very much uh Deepa for those

kind words. Uh [clears throat] at the outset, I would like to thank all the people sitting here. I know how valuable your time is and you've chosen

to sit in this uh session which is exclusively uh about one state which is the Andhra Pradesh. At the outset I would like to thank uh

Ethna Informics for organizing this exclusive session on AP's journey of AI in agriculture and allied sectors. Not long ago, including me, agree and AI appeared far-fetched. In fact, I was a

big skeptic of uh tech in agriculture uh not so long ago. But today, it's the tech world's most sought-after territory. The Ministry of Agriculture just launched the Barat Vistar, a

multilingual AI tool that integrates the Agri stack uh portals and the IC package of agree practices for providing customized advisory support. Happy to inform all of you that a demo of this

immense power of Barat Vistar. A glimpse of Barat Vistar was demonstrated to none other than Mr. Bill Gates on 16th just a few just two days back at a banana farm in Andhra Pradesh.

The farmers demonstrated the pest management flow by doing advanced forewarning of pests followed by AI enabled imagebased detection and remedial advisory for pest and disease

control and use of the uberization service to book a drone for precision application of pesticide through the farmer's AI app and in fact uh Mr. Mr. Bill Gates himself uh tested the AI part

of the app uh by asking a question and and the app gave a fitting reply to to Mr. Bill Gates. But this journey was not without its trials and tribulations. The idea of this session is to share both so

that we cut short the learning curve for those states and for those agencies which want to follow this path. For us, the motivation and drive come from a very strong belief that AI can

transform the lives of the small and marginal farmers. I'm talking about the tenant farmers in Andhra Pradesh who account for nearly 90% of farming and empower the last mile functionaries to

provide more accurate and better advisories to those farmers who are digitally challenged. So we'll have this digital divide always. uh uh just as we thought uh we have brided that gap as

far as smartphones are concerned now AI will again go into determine uh you know who is uh challenged and who's not challenged so we are also designing system time for the last systems for the

last five mile functionaries who would be providing that human touch to the farmers to begin with the vision of our state swarnandra 2047 aligned with vixit bharat 204 47 to transform Andhra

Pradesh's primary sector which contributes 33% of state GSTP into a globally competitive climate resilient and valued-driven food economy through sustainable technologydriven growth that

uplifts farmer livelihoods while addressing global challenges. I think many of you are not aware that after bifurcation AP became the classic agrarian economy uh economy state with

more than 60% population still depending on agriculture as a livelihood and contributing more than 30% of the GSTP. The national average for your information is 18%. And the the other

divided state Telangana also the primary sector contributes only 18%. For us it's 33%. Our honorable CM Mr. Narat Chandra Naidu envisions a 2.4 trillion economy by 2047

in line with the national vision of Vixidbarat with a targeted per capita income of 55 lakhs by 2047 by achieving a sustained annual growth of over 15% year on year.

We can't achieve that target of 2.4 4 trillion economy unless we grow starting now every year 15%. And with 33% of the economy depending on the primary sector. I leave the maths to you how important

uh the primary sector is to set to set in motion. Uh uh so as I've said the primary sector is going to be the key to this vision and therefore there's an urgent need to

transform the current traditional mindset of farmers and the different stakeholders including the departments including the ministries. uh there is a the the current mindset has to change to

a more datadriven evidence-based choices in a very chaotic global ecosystem where a random day like the announcement of tariffs by the US president has an impact on a small aqua

farmer in a remote village of AP. This we never never anticipated. a decision by somewhere far off country president has a direct impact on a small uh aqua farmer in a remote village. So to set in

motion this game-changing endeavor of mindset transformation our honorable chief minister laid down five guiding principle which I think uh others may actually have a look at. First

agriculture needs water. So we need to have a a water security system uh by making water efficient uh micro irrigation, soil moisture management and uh recharging groundwater sustainably

through village level water budgeting. This is extremely important. And in fact in Andhra Pradesh uh we have uh the Wasar technologies uh you know building a water resources uh uh management uh

system which gives real time uh availability of water in uh you know medium irrigation tanks, minor irrigation tanks, major irrigation tanks because this is extremely critical.

Second is demand-driven mapping of the production to connect farm to plate and pro provide better salailability to farmers. This is extremely important because we find that today the crop

planning has nothing to do with the demand. The farmers you know many of times it's the herd mentality that kicks in. So if my neighboring farmers grows maze I'll grow

maze. If he grows tobacco I'll grow tobacco. not really understanding uh you know what uh the international markets how they are uh dynamically changing and how

the prices may just collapse overnight and at the end of the end of the uh that crop period we find that the farmers are left in alert so how do we use or leverage AI to do that kind of a

crop planning where we'll be able to factor in all the external uh variables. Then of course agri tech adoption. The third fourth is food processing. Today we find you know many of you must be

reading in newspapers that suddenly the tomato prices collapse and the farmers have nothing else to do but just dump the tomatoes on on the road because they can't do anything with that tomato

because it's uh the price is 1 rupee 2 rupees. So the food processing you know extremely uh becomes extremely important for the farmer's sustainability. And the last is when everything fails when the

the market fails and you know there's another there's nothing else the farmer can do there has to be a government systems that step in and support through market interventions like price

stabilization funds etc. Now this whole journey uh you know the AI journey what Mr. Bill Gates has seen uh day before yesterday and the banana farm has not happened overnight. It's

been a very arduous uh journey. Uh [clears throat and cough] I'd like to give a a small context uh that you know our primary sector now stands at a unique intersection of

global opportunity and climate change challenge. uh many of you must be aware that uh in the recent uh discussions at Davos uh the this was highlighted and uh a critical insight was discussed

agriculture today is viewed as part of the climate problem because uh 40% of the climate change problem is because of agriculture but I think we need to reverse that

whole paradigm 180° and and view agriculture can become a solution not not the problem and it becomes holds immense potential as one of the world's most powerful solutions for climate

resilience biodiversity restoration and inclusive growth. The state is demonstrating this at an unprecedented scale with 1.8 million farmers across 60% of our villages practicing natural

farming on 2 million acres. I'm I'm sure people sitting here or watching on YouTube may not be knowing these numbers, but AP today is uh the world's largest uh natural farming uh uh uh

state uh as I've said with more than 2 million acres and uh and 1.8 million farmers practicing it. Uh providing that proving that climate action doesn't require sacrifice by the poor. All of us

are aware that climate change uh impacts the poor the most. Even though they contribute uh nothing to the climate change problem but they are the biggest uh I mean it impacts them the maximum.

Uh so therefore the the entire AP climate uh the uh uh community- managed uh natural farming uh system that we have delivered uh in AP uh has different models where the farmers even with as

little as 20 cents of land 1/5 of an acre can get incomes of more than 25,000 uh you know per per year. uh uh uh that kind of farmer centric kind of models uh we have done where the uh giving options

to the farmers to cut their cost of cultivation without affecting the yields even here even in natural farming where we are going to use the elements from the nature AIdriven solutions like

traceability with certification uh will provide better price premiums to even a 1acre farmer. Today the world is moving to a scenario where even in an ordinary restaurant the customer may

demand I would like to know where this where this vegetable is grown. I mean that's the kind of scenario we are going to see in the next uh uh not uh decades but uh in few years. So the traceability

you know becomes extremely important. we need to devise uh systems on blockchain uh technologies and we are actually doing in collaboration with Gates Foundation AP has taken sector wise

initiatives on AI and tech implementation that are driving transformation from traditional mindset as I've said today still there is a uh this traditional uh mindset not just

with the farmers but even the other important uh stakeholders uh from traditional mindset to technology enabled Entrepreneurial farming that is efficient, future ready,

sustainable and resilient. In animal husbandry for example, we are using AI based muzzle ID. We call it go Aadhaar. Just as we have Aadhaar uh we are now come up with go Aadhaar because that

muzzle uh uh design is unique for each animal. So this ID based on muzzle ID based traceability system uh will enable precise health history mapping and uh resource uh optimization in fisheries.

AI and IoT solutions are revolutionizing revolutionizing aquaculture uh achieving 30% reduction in power consumption. There's one I would urge any of you to I mean if you can visit or even uh Google

search uh this uh agency called Aqua Exchange uh they have done extremely uh useful IoT devices uh which takes care of you know the endtoend problems of an aqua farmer in natural farming use of

traceability across 21 lakh hectares with complete systems integrated with global certification standards s positioning our produce for premium international markets particularly the

new EU FDA opportunities then we have dronebased services cover over 60,000 hectares annually through more than 9,700 integrated service providers giving small farmers access to advanced

machinery while using just 20 to 25% of traditional water and fertilizer inputs now even I used to think that drone is an expensive intervention. But today we realize with uh the labor cost shooting

up it's going north and north and and therefore uh drone I think is going to become a normal kind of an activity for not just pesticide spraying but even for seed uh uh spraying over fields.

We have launched AP as uh which is our state's uh primary uh digital platform for agriculture that integrates agri stack and generate use cases for farmers. We are using remote sensing to

monitor sewing status crop type and crop health across nearly 1.44 cr field parcels in the state. I think uh Nicholas is going to uh show you the uh the details of these interventions. Uh

and we are even able to counter crops at individual tree level uh counting more than 2.4 cr coconut and 1.4 cr palm trearies. Today I don't know how many of you are aware the whole

area that is being talked about in this country is an approximation. Nobody has counted trees. It's just uh you know if if there are some 30 trees in a acre they are going to say that acre of field

has a particular horiculture farm. Today this counting of trees is going to revolutionize because we are able to then look at productivity in terms of trees not just the area. The farmer app

has AI assistant for farmer and extension officer aligning to Barat Vistar goals of bringing multilingual voice enabled personalized schemes and financial packages assistance along with

hyperlocal farm and crop specific advisories crop planning fertilizer management uberization services like drones and farm missionaries. If this speech was uh just a standalone, I'm

sure many of you would have thought, you know, this is a bureaucratic kind of a uh speech that's being given. Luckily, I have uh the next session, Nikesh is actually going to show you what is

actually transpired in the state. Now, we thought this session should also talk about the learnings and challenges. And the first uh learning and challenges for me and I think uh uh particularly with

reference to the the tech partners I always say that uh whoever comes to me uh tech farmers saying we want to work with the government they always come with a solution seeking

a problem. They have a solution. They have already developed a solution sitting in their comfortable AC rooms designed it everything and now they are coming and asking me please tell give me

the problem so that this solution can fit there. So I think that's the that mindset from the tech uh partners also is a big challenge. I think the tech partners

should realize that uh the first and foremost uh the tools the AI is just a tool uh which should enable uh you know ultimately the outcome of uh a benefit to the human

being. So that's the that's a big challenge. Of course there are data issues, data errors, data disconnects. Data integrity is key. In fact, I keep uh you

know, in all my meetings, I keep saying that at the end of this arduous journey of developing a beautiful system, if all that the system is doing is just crunching some data which has no

relevance to the actual truth, this whole system has no meaning. That's what many of the systems today are. they look beautiful, beautiful graphs are shown. But then it's all based on data which is

which is questionable. So data integrity I think is uh next important uh challenge that we need to look at their accuracy of these models. Many of these are just models. These are big

algorithms end of the day but they're just modeling simulating. So we need to establish the accuracy of these uh models. If you don't do that many a times uh in fact this is what our

honorable CM always whenever we present a beautiful uh PPT of uh a new idea he listens to it but at end of the uh all that presentation he asks tell me what is the accuracy of this uh your model

that we don't uh you know the ground truthing are we doing the ground truthing uh that's that's the key limited access to GPUs now everybody's is talking about uh you know chat bots

and then usage of uh AI uh based uh tools but then all these require a lot of infrastructures where is that infrastructure coming from does

the states have a provision for providing all this infrastructure for the DPIs so GPUs in fact we found that uh is is a big limitation unless the state has the capacities ities you'll

not be able to do the LLMs and your machine learning without that. Then of course finally it's the farmer acceptance of these advisories. uh many of times we think we have developed a

beautiful system uh for the farmer but the actual farmer may not accept it and that's I keep telling my team that it's the numbers how many have like WhatsApp [snorts]

we use WhatsApp because we know its benefits so uh unless the farmers feel that this uh app is useful for me again all all our investments and resources in creating that app will go waste.

Of course, the next steps uh I've talked about the vision, I talked about uh the challenges. Now the next steps as I've said we are taking these solutions to 85 lakh cultivators and citizens. I've

specifically used the word cultivator because not always uh uh you know uh the today u many of the systems are driven by uh not looking at actual cultivator but something uh you know because the

systems are available. So land owners all our land records are computerized. Therefore that's the easy uh kind of data set that we can take. But then that data set actually uh eliminates lot of

real cultivators. So how do we build in a system where the real cultivators are also be part of inclusive uh into this system? uh we need to bring these services at a hyper local and farm

specific with feedback loop from the farmer. This is important because many a times even a chatbot uh we've seen the messages that the system generates is a general kind of a message. It doesn't

take the hyperlocal factors of that particular farmer. So we should be able to AI should be able to help us uh take into account those specific inputs from the farmer's field and give uh the

feedback. The human touch point is important for reducing the gap in awareness, trust and access. Integration of the services at economic unit at the uh at the cutting edge is important. And

then of course cost. In fact, many a times we have a solution uh like in the beginning drone was a good uh uh uh frontier tech kind of a solution but the uh in one meeting uh with Chile farmers

our CM asked are you using drone? So the farmer said yes sir we tried but it's much cheaper to do the uh spraying with human. So cost uh is always a factor we need to keep in mind. I'll end with an

analogy with another AI artificial insemination in the animal husbandry field. Uh from conventional AI to sexed cement technology to today we are talking about embryo transfer.

This AI too, artificial insemin artificial intelligence 2 needs to embrace the human philosophy that the future belongs to those who go who go dare to who dare to go there. Thank you.

Thank you so much. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Sir, I can say this firsthand just based on the experience of have had of having the privilege of working with the state government over

the last couple of weeks that it's it's not common to see the ability to have aspirational targets but to also back it up with a very practical strategy and road maps that will deliver those

targets and more importantly the ability to say something isn't working and co course correct quickly. I think it's an honor to work with the state government and to have experienced that firsthand

and the Gates Foundation has been a very critical partner in that journey of both supporting the states with best practices from around the world and in the country. So I'd like to invite

Rialdi Krishnan, deputy director of the Gates Foundation to share a Oh, please. Absolutely. Yeah, you can just speak from &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Thank you so much

Deepa and um I think it's an honor to share the stage with um with Shri Rajikhar GI with whom we've been partnering for a very long time. Um I would just say that um in the last

couple of days of course uh we've been able to show what AI can do at the farmer end both to honorable CM as well as Bill um in terms of what is the future of AI in agriculture and AI

enabled advisory. I think one of the things that I really appreciate is not just the state's willingness to partner and test out solutions, take the risks, be the first

doctor, but also being able to use data for evidence and decision making. And I'm not talking of this in 2026. I'm talking of this way back in 1995 when the honorable CM met with the met with

um Bill at that time um as the CEO of Microsoft. Um it is important to note that when we are using data for decision making there are challenges in terms of what is the quality of data and I think

the Andhra Pradesh as a state has really invested in taking that step to improve the foundational quality of data because once you're looking at data being not of great quality the decisions are actually

taken on that which sometimes can go wrong. So the foundational layer which Andra actually looked at really addressing is the root cause problem of quality at the grassroot level with AP

IM2 one and now two and I know um Nicollesh will talk a little bit more on that. Um it is important to understand that data for decision making is also rooted with a lot of fidgetital u ground

truthing and understanding. It is not that the AI had given a pest for warning or a weather advisory that you take it at the face value but you rather use the ground truththing capability of whether

the rau sumiksha kendras or the kvks or other field functionaries to ground truth that data in real time and being able to reduce the turnaround time significantly.

If we look at the um the average uh number of extension workers to farmers in India, it is 1 in 10,000. Even if we recruit a whole lot of new extension workers, we can never get to a

point where we will be able to look at an optimum size of one extension worker for every 250 farmers. That's not possible. So this is where where we talk about use of AI to be able to deliver

quality real time advisory and information to the farmer at the last end can both be faster, cheaper, real time and accurate and this is the promise that we see Andra as a state

really um you know sparing spare heading in that direction and for other states in India to follow and not just other states I would say it is setting an example for globally how AI can actually

transform in terms of citizencentric services whether it is access to inputs like seeds fertilizers mechanization or or even like you know access to

drones for spraying and so on to all the way to connecting it to the market and really looking at post-h harvest management from processing side. So this is an endtoend holistic value chain

based approach which is not rooted on one siloed approach for one small problem and I really liked what Rajikarji mentioned as we look at more and more solutions coming in from

private sector it is important that private sector doesn't look at it as a solutionoriented problem we should be looking at what is the demand for services to make that solution tailored

to that demand to be sustainable otherwise a lot of startups lot of tech companies would be losing their charm in the value of death. So it is important that we actually approach a demand

centric approach where farmer finds value where there is an option for revenue generation and really take it from there. And finally, I know we would like to see the APIs too uh from uh

Nikile to give us a demo on that. But I do want to share that we are looking at the promise of AI for tomorrow and for tomorrow we are not looking at this replaces the human touch and I just

wanted to re reiterate that there is always a requirement of a human touch because eventually something has to go on the field. There is the need for the farmer to go and take that action. So we

are not replacing the human touch. We are just making that touch get faster and cheaper. With that, thank you so much Deepa. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Shali. And I think

that's such an important note because the skepticism or the fear of displacing human human intelligence is a very is a very perceptible one right through the conference. So you address that head on.

Thank you so very much. With that, Nikil, the much awaited APMS. I think we're all excited to see the demo and what APMS is doing. over to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, good afternoon everyone. Thanks uh

Deepa. So I think we have put a presentation for that. Uh &gt;&gt; you can just use so APMS uh very similar to what uh Sh has already briefed. uh we started with

the focus of uh how tech needs to go to the last mile and putting farmer at the center. Uh what predominantly we are doing here is uh how uh cultivator be it tenant or the farmer uh brings or get uh

hyper local personalized advisory which is very specific to the farmer's farm and uh bring services right from u farmers uh planning to productivity enhancement input management climate

resilient agriculture at the farm but also link it to the various other services related to farm machinery, drone, uh financial services, insurance, risk at the same time bring the

government support and schemes uh right at the hand of the farmer. And with that being the goal, the construct of the entire system has been done and it is kind of leveraging on the top of uh

works done both at the national and state level connecting with agree stack uh to bring uh farmer a very easy access uh to the uh system where farmer just has to log in with their national ID

Aadhaar or farmer registry and no need to do any further entry. So farmer gets to see all the farms that he has and uh as he clicks on a particular farm he sees farm specific advisories and then

there is a multilingual AI assistant which basically prompt an uh prompt the farmer that there is a alert for his farm and would he like to basically see those alerts there is an advisory and

these advisory all dynamic and hyper local so what I'll do is I'll quickly jump towards u u some of the works uh that you would like to see and the idea here is to bring one digital ecosystem.

So not just for the farmer but upscale to the uh RSK unit level where uh the department and the extension officer is enabled with all these uh information analytics and actionable insights and

also bring it to the industry and uh research institutions through a sandbox environment. So pretty much uh the goal here is to bring state to plot level where farmer

farm crop and services are all connected. What you're seeing in the left hand side is where multiple data sets have been aggregated from um uh right from agree stack and uh revenue

records and um these uh data sets bring informations related to uh crop right in the GIS uh mode and uh you get to see each plot level and uh further to that uh the connections u uh bring uh the

informations at the farmer's farm far uh crop farmers uh app where um uh don't play the video just do the full screen here. uh where these uh informations you see

is being brought in the screen that you're seeing is a screenshot from the farmer app where the farmer sees multiple farms and on the farm the farmer sees also crop specific

advisories and soil nutrient. This is a part where I would like to focus more and just give some glimpse where now all these informations that you see is also accessible in a

vernacular app format where the farmer can interact through clicks and navigate through the app but also it creates access and knowledge gaps where farmer do not know where to drill down and it's

not possible for enabling each individual farmers. Of course there is a physical model where a human is there to assist at the RSK level but touching all the farmers to adopt these digital

services difficult. This is where what we have done is brought all these information into a seamless uh uh farmer's uh assistant uh uh we are calling AI agree scientist for the

farmer where it's not just bringing his farm and schemes information but also all related to the uh the best practice and farm specific informations farm specific advisories hyperlocal weather

crop uh and soil related and I'll just play some of them. So if you may play the first one. So here you would be able to see the farmer just uh can see with interactions and these are all prompt

driven to the farmer where &gt;&gt; how much money I got from anata sukihawa scheme &gt;&gt; and in this case farmer doesn't have to put any information at the backdrop. The

beauty is it's integrate the data from farmer registry. It integrates the data from the bank. It integrates the data from the schemes and bring into one uh seamless environment. The second is

hyper localal information on the price. H the guru. So here the farmer gets he's not asking any specific I want to know the price of this crop. He's asking crop specific to

the farm. He just say my farm what are the prices that I can avail. Uh and then related to soil health, related to irrigation advisory, related to pest management, related to uberization. Um

we'll just show one more and um so these conversations based uh AI assistant is also upscaled to the uh extension service level where uh the extension officer basically gets to see

in the village where he is managing what are the lands what are the crops what are the u uh variations in the marginal farms and land utilization types but also he gets to know realtime

information related to weather, water availability, the risk that he needs to assist to the farmers uh various uh climate resilient related advisory. In addition, the economic layer is also

added where the uh RSK officer get to know in real time what are the prices crop and also are scaling into the GVA of the uh unit which he is managing and all of them are brought both in a

dashboard format in a map format and in the app with the AI assistant. Some of the other use cases which I'll just brush through is we make a lot use of uh remote sensing data to brought to

bring real-time monitoring. So each parcels are being monitored whether the parcel is sewn and uh once the sewing information is known uh in between the season what is the crop that is also

being uh detected using the remote sensing. Then like sir said we are doing uh each individual tree counts. We we have created very unique uh signatures and advancement that has happened in the

recent AI especially vision AI. Uh we have created specific models for AP where palm, coconut tree but also we are now doing mango, lime and cashew. Then we are also doing real-time

monitoring on the health of the crop which is in the uh plot and at a real time as a near real time at a day 10 day 5 day gap we are able to know which plot is actually going into a stress.

This is a pest precision management with a goal of how do we reduce the cost of cultivation by uh pesticide use but also reduce the pesticide into the uh food chain and it has a three-step approach

where we are doing a pest forewarning in advance and is scaled for the whole state and it goes all the way to the farmer level where farmer gets to get a like advisory there is a forewarning in

advance to come and farmer can go to the field click a click a image and AI uh based uh image based detection service provides him what is a crop or what is a pest or disease and also with remedial

and there itself the farmer can book a Uber service. We have also opened up uh a sandbox environment which is internal to the department where the AI is taken into

democratized format to the hands of uh officers who can further re improve the models and also rebuild on the top of it and new use cases but also data access to pro to create new innovative services

and use cases on the top of existing ones. Thank you so much Nikil. That was fantastic. I have great thank you so much. That was

fantastic. A huge applause for Nicol because I think &gt;&gt; right like Agri stack is the digital backbone. AP Ames is the brain right like it really does much of the thinking

and the analytics. uh something that Athena and Phanomics and CMS's partners are really excited is to now build on that backbone and then say how do we really

take it to the last mile right so this question of okay this technology this analytics there's so much value that's being built now how do we really activate it and make it make sure that

it's useful at the last mile and that means we need to work within the techno human capital infrastructure and the ecosystem that already exists within the So Nikil already covered what APMS does

quite beautifully. What I'll talk about today is really the work that we're just getting started on which is how can we really supercharge the RSK network as agents of transformation and really

focus on what Shivali quite beautifully captured right which is there is no scenario we're going to get one extension worker for 250 farmers that is not a practical reality. So how do we do

more with less and that's not just a quantitative gap but it's also a qualitative gap and sir you've told us in several meetings that you know in if there is a big hot you're not going to

get a hoticulture specialist in every area but you may need that specialist skills. So how do we address both the quantitative and the qualitative gap and we're doing this through two main

intervention levers. The first is a decision intelligence system, right? What is that last smile intelligence layer that the RSK can be equipped with that allows them to deconstruct targets,

understand what that means at a very local level and also start thinking about ways in which they can deliver value and my colleague Natisha will talk about that in a minute. Uh and then

there is the sandbox. Now there is the intelligence piece but there's also the service delivery piece right I think there is real power in taking and designing digital services and taking it

to the last mile and the focus of the innovation sandbox is how do you really design and build that AI and frontier tech layer to supercharge services for the farmers and obviously at every stage

we're very clear that what matters is the farmer and and more so the tenant to farmer, right? We're so that we're not losing sight of the the the small hold and tenant farmers and looking at

questions of how are we reducing damages or improving productivity or cutting down on input costs or expanding credit markets for the farmers with a big focus on GVA or gross value

addition as the northstar in terms of impact while also looking at the resilience dividend in nutrition. Now, in the interest of time, I think we've I think one of the biggest themes if for

those of you who've been at the the the AI summit is just this fatigue with pilots, right? Like everybody's tired of pilots, right? They so and there's a lot of focus on then asking this question of

how do we think about scale and how we how can we design for scale get-go? And I don't think I have the answer to that question. I think we're going to learn how to do that by being very aware that

that's what matters from the get-go. And I'll give you an example of what that means uh in the context of one of the aspirations that Rajiko G outlined in his keynote address which is drone based

services and the target for precision farming and the value that it can unlock for farmers in the state of Andhra Pradesh. There is already a lot of builtup infrastructure right in the

state. There is AP Ames, there's Agri Stack, we have drone operators, certified operators that are all part of the AP drone march ecosystem. We have a human capital network of 8,000 plus

extension workers. How do we now take that and start talking about where can precision farming add value? And we're starting with something that's come up over and

over again both in the work that we've done so far in the state but also more so in the summit here is trust or the last mile trust infrastructure. Start by talking to farmers to see where is their

value for precision farming and what do they need. There is already an Uberization app that's been built as part of AP Ames uh which we will leverage again doesn't

have to be built from scratch. We're just going to take that system and then the AIdriven shoulduling also already exists within the state government infrastructure which will allow us to

then say how do we think about where there is value and how the matchmaking can happen with the drone service providers because something like this simply will not work without demand side

and supply side aggregation and there are economies of scale and remember drones are not just you know you can't just fly a drone and do pest spraying we have to look at wind velocity we have to

look at weather on that specific Okay, there are lots of considerations to be taken into account when we're talking about precision farming. It's very crucial for us to start with the data.

We can't talk about the precision piece. We're not just talking about flying a drone over a piece of land and spraying. We're talking about precision spraying. So in the workflow what we're going to

be systematically testing as part of the sandbox is what would that datadriven intelligence layer look like through a drone based service that will create these polygons right that can be

verified by an aonomist obviously the farmer has the ultimate override we don't the liability and the consent architecture requires that the farmer says yes I want to do this and only then

we proceed these polygons will form the premise or the basis for the targeted spray execution. One thing I want to highlight here that's really exciting that we're keen to test is the data

layer is more than just precision best yield is a huge part of the data ecosystem that we all struggle with because crop cutting experiments are expensive and we don't really have very

reliable data. So that datadriven intelligence layer can give us more than just pesans. They can give us a lot of very valuable data. uh once the spray is done we want a

clear before and after what is the customer sat what is the farmer satisfaction but we'll also allow for digital traceability and potentially linkages to insurance in terms of

triggers which goes back to the point that Shivali mentioned we're not looking at this in silos we want something that's integrated that's touching on several dimensions and has to be privacy

by design and finally how do we then use some form of crop calendaring to make sure there is a trigger-based alert and the system continues and how can we learn from this process to reduce the

survey to spray time and continue to build on it. Uh with that Natish I'll hand it off to you to talk about the Ysk intelligence layer. &gt;&gt; Thanks Deepa. I think I have about two

minutes. So let me &gt;&gt; No, you you actually have five we have five more minutes after the zero. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I think uh thanks Deepa and

thanks so much Raj sir uh for the keynote and it's a pleasure to work with the state that puts like you said cultivators at the center and the science tech system around it that is

extremely key and that is what at CMS we believe in and to work with somebody who shares the same values is extremely important and uh thank you for the anda team for inviting us and putting us on

the panel. Thank you so much for that. Um so I'll start with like how are we leveraging like uh Deepa mentioned the work that Vasad has done and the work that the AP uh the state has done for

the last decades and decades and decades like Shi put it has given us this huge leverage that we have where you already have a base at which you can work on right and ultimately the goal here is to

improve farmers income for which you put you have to put RSK at the center because only via the RSK you will be able to reach the last mile at the end of the day so what we have right now is

we have foundational APIs We spoke about APMS, we spoke about EPA, we spoke about agree and so on. The other important thing is the trust infrastructure that is existing in this state of over 10,000

RSKS is extremely crucial because the farmer adoption adoption of farmers is something Rajkas has spoke about right just because we have tech doesn't mean the farmer is going to adopt it. The

trust network will play a huge role in making sure the farmer adopt these technologies and tools which is going to be extremely crucial and the state has invested a lot in that and that's an

extremely important asset that we should look at. And last comes because of the systems that we have. We have sector specific data that we have. So we're not starting from scratch. Now currently the

RSKS act as service centers. What we want to do is make them intelligence hubs. That is the journey we are on which is the next steps which we spoke about earlier as well where you have a

defined shared intelligence which can come across sectors. You don't look at the primary sectors in isolation. You have synergies between them. You can optimize for them which becomes

extremely powerful and you have actionable insights at the hyper local level because what might work in a particular field in Anandraur is not going to work in East Godavari. The

nature of farmers are different, the soil is different, the crop is different, the climate conditions are extremely different. So having hyperlocal insights is extremely

crucial. And the third point of recursive learning is something I want to emphasize on because RSKS are the one who are closest to the ground and you know they will learn something from the

ground which has to feed back to the system. This recursive learning is extremely important to make the system work. This also increases the RSK's trust in the system because they know

they are inputting to it and that is what is coming back to them which is extremely important. The feedback loop. Okay. Times up. I have two more minutes I believe. Okay.

Yeah. Yeah. At the end of the day while AI is the catalyst we are at the AI summit. The data systems are the foundations which the state has invested in the last decade or two which has make

a big which has made a big difference where we are able to supercharge this network via AI at this point in time. Uh so quickly in terms of how we are exactly doing this right and Deepa spoke

about uh doing more with less right and I wanted to touch upon a little bit in terms of how exactly that is going to happen. So we have targets allocation and planning that flows from the state

at this point in time and you have hyperlocal signal solution banks that are coming bottom up. Right? Integrating these two systems is extremely crucial. While planning comes from the state

understanding based on hyperlocal signals at the RSK level that feeds back into the planning is extremely important. Right? Because like we have spoken in the past as well things change

so fast on the ground. While there are macroeconomic conditions that affect a situation on the ground, there are local ground conditions as well which affect a lot. Having the system feedback into

each other is extremely important. Having the solution bank which is sourced from the RSKS themselves and from the departments that we work with is extremely crucial because we have had

a lot of success stories. They have been RSKS that have done very well that have contributed to extremely high GVs. Bringing this back into the system and then democratizing that knowledge across

the RSKS itself can supercharge this network quite a lot. Right. And lastly, Rajasa spoke about this. It has to be grounded in reality and the only person or the only individual who can ground

that is the RS case with the farmer. That is extremely important for the system to work together because without that you might have solutions. uh he calls it theoretical exercises but then

again it doesn't make a difference if it doesn't add to farmer's income at the end of the day which is what we are looking at here right and yeah data tech and AI are all levers that allow for

this but these principles should be there for data tech and AI to actually enable farmer income and economy the end of the day right and another component I wanted to focus on is change management

is going to be extremely crucial uh because just because we have a tech system doesn't mean RSK's are going to adopt it what is the buyin for the RSK for the system what is the buyin for the

farmer to trust the RSK took last 20 years to build right so similarly you will need a huge change management exercise for RSKs to adopt these systems they're used to certain styles of

working an app is necessarily not going to change that so investing a lot in this and creating protocols and frameworks and taking their feedback which is extremely important it

shouldn't be another app or another file that they will have to fill this is extremely crucial here now what this allows us to do is to build that rich data corpus that the state can build

throughout this which gives you contextual intelligence because the corpus is coming from the ground now. It is not just top down which is coming from the state or some open data that we

have. It is coming contextual to the ground which actually lowers the cost of delivering that intelligence because it's contextual to that particular geography. Right? And this is a loop.

Now this contextual intelligence is going back to the data corpus. So at the end of the day what you have is by in by integrating the statewide planning with RSK level intelligence you enable an RSK

to act as an intelligence hub which is the vision that we have right and lastly just to kind of bring it all together in one place the primary sector is very very nuanced. Agriculture is not the

same as articulture. Livestock is very different. Fisheries are very different and soil conditions are extremely local. And within that each of those sectors you have various factors affecting how

each sector will go. Right? It's not just on the profile of farmers. It's based on climatic conditions. Production cycles are very different and so on. Now at the center of all this complexity is

RSK. This is something that is extremely important to understand. The RSK is the one who actually at today sits at as a delivery point. Who understands this complexity and deliver and delivers

services to all these primary sectors that we are talking about. So every interaction that the RSK makes be the crop choice, input demand, livestock, livestock activity, farmer feedback and

so on is captured back into the system that strengthens the hyper hyperlocal intelligence. It is not a one-way street. It is a two-way street where the RSK contributes to the system and the

system contributes to the RSK. Right? Now as the data corpus go grows, the RSK evolves into an intelligence hub. Now once the RSK evolves into an intelligence hub that is where Deepa's

point of the system begins to do more with less is something that we can see in action. Now the RSK is equipped to with hyperlocal AI the agents can carry that intelligence forward uh to Shali's

vision of having an agent or an AI that can serve let's say 10,000 farmer with a single RSK then becomes possible. Every farmer has access to scientific intelligence and that's how we achieve

southern in the primary sector based on intelligence built from our own ground realities anchor in our own institutions. Thank you all. [applause]

&gt;&gt; Thanks a tan Natish I think so I I often get made fun of for talking really fast but I feel like Natish almost to do it faster than I do but thanks a ton. I know we're out of time, but we're I

think we're all going to be here for a bit. So, if the audience do want to interact with the panelists, you're welcome to do so. I just want to end with saying some just to summarize that

one of the things that excites me is that here there is the courage to try new things and the conviction to stay the course and that's not something that's common. So, we're all incredibly

excited to be a part of this journey and learn along the way. A huge thanks to Raj Shaker sir for being here with us to deliver the keynote. Shali Krishnan from the Gates Foundation, Nikile from Vaser

and Nitish um from Catalyst Management Services. Thank you all and thank you all for being here with us on day three of a summit. So thank you everyone. Hope you enjoy the rest of the

This is like a photograph. I think &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I think you
