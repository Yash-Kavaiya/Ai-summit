## 📝 Transcript

the institutions of disasterous governance. It is really important that whatever we do in terms of deploying these tools, it really strengthens disasterous governance. It does not

create you know you know confusion uh so much room for misinformation and disinformation. So it's really important that it strengthens disasterous governance systems. My final point and

this is particularly looking beyond 2030 is to say that the world has made tremendous progress in saving lives. Uh SAI framework has several targets. The first target is reducing mortality.

Decade on decade mortality is down by 50%. But as many people as 10 years ago are losing their houses, their livelihoods the economic impacts are going through the roof. What we really

need is a deeper transformation. So those who are working on developing AI tools, I would urge you to look at problems that need to be solved, not problems that we can solve. You know, we

have to look beyond what is apparent, what is really visible in front of us. How do we use AI tools to inform housing policy so that 20 years from now the entire world is uh is resilient? We lose

far fewer houses uh far fewer infrastructure. So how do we work on deeper transformation? That's my only plea. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. A very clear challenge. Thank

you Kamal. So now we'll turn to Kamal please. So thank you so much for hosting us today. Uh from my perspective uh success in an AIdriven world cannot mean

technological advancement only. It must mean inclusion, affordability and access at scale. Today nearly 70% of global filings come from large companies and 85% of them are

only concentrated in five regions of the world. That means that most startups, universities,memes and emerging economies remain structurally disadvantaged in owing innovation and IP

sovereignity. Speaking as a founder who's built and scaled up an AI company in legal tech, we built AI not to chase trends but to correct these imbalances. We used smaller uh open-source

fine-tuned models, embedding and rag architectures. We used domain specific data sets. We combined AI and domain specific talent and we made advanced innovation tools affordable to all and

we have already impacted more than 1 million students and researchers in India and more than 100 universities. I think what fundamentally changes in an AIdriven world is that AI can collapse

barriers of cost, expertise and scale. But this will only drive global development if we scale responsibly and we design inclusion from the beginning across key areas like healthare,

agriculture, education and research in India. Governments have a very critical role in providing access to subsidized compute to startups, support for open model and lightweight models, investing

in quality data sets and strong AI talent pipelines and of course nurturing startups and giving them financial pathways. Two things must not change in today's world. Human judgment and

context must remain at the center of AI and the AI should complement the human expertise and not replace it. And number two, we have to continue to upskill and reskill our workforce and this has to be

the endeavor both of public and private institutions. I would like to end by saying that beyond 2030 especially for the developing world success is not going to be measured by how big models

we have or we developed but it will be shaped by how many people those models empower. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Excellent. Thank you. Great message especially for the governments in in the

room. Thank you. Um Signbo I'm going to turn to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Dorin. Uh good morning everyone. Uh from the World Bank point uh point of

view AI can bring a lot of more opportunity as you know but more important I think is how can we really practically utilize this technology for our daily lives.

So many people are thinking uh and talking about um pre- requirements for AI such as energy, internet connectivity, computing power, data sets, talents, all of those are very

important but that we cannot fully waiting until all of those prerequisites are get ready getting ready. So more important thing for now for everyone is that developing and finding

real practical solutions by fully harnessing AI technology to [music] support our people whether it is farmer, teachers, students, patients, medical doctors, whoever

whoever needs this technology. So from the World Bank point of view, we are the you know developing so-called the small AI which is very practical, affordable and the locally relevant uh

the solutions regardless any some constraint of our resources. So we are really developing some some really good practices uh for this. So I believe that will be the good starting point. all of

us can think about how can we really use this AI uh in this era. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much Sang Buu. So now we'll turn to Shankar. Please over to you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Building on what Sangu said, I have a dream that in 2040, a 30-year-old lady from rural Nigeria wins the Nobel Prize in science by doing research in her native language and

accessing the world's greatest minds and research thanks to AI. It's a dream. But so was climbing Mount Everest a dream. Landing on the moon, a dream. Breaking the four-minute mile barrier, a

dream, the breaking the sound barrier, a dream, till someone did it. When they did it, the impossible became possible. But when they did it, they also illuminated a pathway for others to do

it. So you had more and more people dreaming bigger, better. I would like to see the same happen in AI. We we are already seeing this and we call this as a diffusion pathway. The

pathway between AI invention, AI innovation and AI application and impact. There's a massive missing middle and to give you example of what this could look like as XEP Foundation we it

took us and a bunch of partners 9 months to help Maharashtra launch its agriculture AI advisory. 9 months. Then it took 6 months for Bharat Vistar. Then 3 months for Ethiopia open agreeet.

And as of February 11th, 3 weeks for Amul, the world's largest milk cooperative serving 3.6 million farmers, three weeks to launch their AI advisory. What happened? Everyone learned from the

previous person. The the pioneer shared the knowledge with others as Xstep Foundation. Today we have a clear call to action. We would like to collaboratively create 100 pathways by

2030 across sectors across countries across continents and we are already on the journey. What I explained was one pathway but this is a very collaborative

journey. We've had Google and World Bank and UN and several others helping us. If we get to that 100 diffusion paths by 2030, my dream is on its way to becoming true. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. I I think we all want uh that that dream to come true. Um I'm now going to turn to Villis. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Dorene. And thank you

all. I um I look across the room and I realize that everybody in this room has selected to be here for a conversation about AI and development. There's something quite powerful about the

agency that we have to choose this over the 12 other sessions that are happening right now. I think in many ways that gives me quite a deal of hope. Let me share with you an observation I've had

over the course of this week and in our work. My name is Velostar. I lead the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation. And I think we are among the world's largest funders of AI for good with over half a

billion dollars deployed over the last handful of years to build an ecosystem of AI for purpose. Here's the observation. I think so often when we think about capacity building in the

context of development, we talk about quite diffuse metrics. We talk about how do we get governments to share in compute. We talk about building ecosystems that support millions or

hundreds of millions of people. But then we hear the other side of the public conversation. and we say who are the people and institutions we talk about and we see a hyperconentration of

stories around technology companies around pilots maybe around a few interventions that feel quite powerful. I think AI diffusion is to me the new form of something called trickle down

economics it becomes a way that we say we let concentration happen and somehow by lifting those boats everybody else will benefit. I reject the premise in a conversation about development. Our

story here shouldn't just be celebrating the few, but rather really investing in empowering the many and thinking about not how we highlight a few pilots that transform a particular sector, but

really say what is our commitment to the long term to invest in a full ecosystem of capacity that lets us transform systems at scale. And to be quite pragmatic about that, maybe three things

that we might consider doing together. one to move a conversation about the hundreds of billions of dollars of investment we're putting into private sector tech companies and say how do we

match that with public scale political will and capital that lets us invest in public good at the same level. The second to stop thinking entirely about solutions and to go back to something

more fundamental. What is the rightsbased framework? What are the norms, principles and values we want to invest in that shape the society of the future and direct what kind of solutions

we build? And the third to move the agency for these conversations merely from technologists and regulators to a broad-based public conversation. The kind of conversation we're having today

that lets us be something that we decide on together in a democratic process that lets us feel ownership and agency over that future. That lets us say development by 2030 isn't something

that's done by a few for the benefit of the many, but it's done by all of us for all of us. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much, Vitless. Um, so that wraps up our first uh panel

and I want to say I'm feeling very excited. I think our panelist, first of all, they did an amazing job at timekeeping. So, bravo. We're right on time. But also, I'm feeling really

excited because they have laid out kind of the possibilities and the opportunities, the things we're doing right, and the things that we also need to focus on for the future to make sure

that we get it right for everyone. everywhere. So ladies and gentlemen, please give a round of applause to our awesome panel. &gt;&gt; Yes. Before we begin with the SA second

panel, we invite all speakers to come up to the stage for a photo opportunity and uh please stay on the stage. First panel members uh for the photo please. All speakers,

&gt;&gt; could we have the other speakers? Bipin Bippen Pri Minister &gt;&gt; please come up to the front everyone. &gt;&gt; Safia Safia please.

Yes, please remain in your seats because the panel discuss panel discussion will continue after the photo opportunity. Thank you and thank you again to our town hall speakers for the first

session. We will move on to part two. &gt;&gt; See you soon. &gt;&gt; Thank you. May I may I invite the speakers for the second round to &gt;&gt; just just come on.

&gt;&gt; Yes. So I would like to introduce the speakers for the second part of the town hall to the stage. Mr. Bin Pri Singh, co-founder and CEO Mobyqu, Miss Claire Melamid, vice president of United

Nations Nations Foundation. Mr. Osama Monzar, founder and director of digital empowerment foundation. Miss Paula Bogantes Samura, Minister of Science and Technology Costa Rica. Mr. Robert Up,

Chief Digital Officer from UNDP. And Mr. Surya Ganguli, Associate Professor of Applied Physics, Stanford Institution for Human-entered AI &gt;&gt; and Safia Hussein from Kar.

Yes, the floor is back to you, USGL. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Rebecca. Thank you, Dorene, for leading us through a very exciting discussion in the previous round. And we're going to continue that

with uh some new perspectives. Uh so we have a mix here uh of uh senior government officials, uh startups, exciting startups in the AI space, more established startups.

Bippin, you are a unicorn now many times over is it? Uh and leaders from within the UN system, UNDP and uh someone who's worked a lot on data for development cla uh and then of course we have a strong

civil society perspective digital empowerment foundation with Osama. So my question the second question that we're going to explore is around inclusion risk and responsibility. Uh so

as AI reshapes these development pathways, Shanka mentioned those hundred arrows coming out of each one of those goals, what are the most serious risks of exclusion, fragmentation of

international development cooperation or inequality or in other words, what should we do differently in the next two to three years to prevent those kind of outcomes and may I invite Bippen Pri to

kick us off. and we'll keep it and I think Antoneta is there to remind us of the time limits. &gt;&gt; Um thank you thank you for firstly for

inviting me in this session. So just for introduction I am Bipin Pit Singh. I'm founder and CEO of Mobyquick. We are a listed company based in India. So we operate in the space of fintech which is

finance plus technology and uh we have products and solutions in the space of payments, digital payments as well as digital loans uh digital investments, digital advice uh all through an app

that currently is being used by more than 180 million people uh across the length and breadth of country and about 4 and a half five billion small businesses as well and you know we've

been around for 10 15 years 15 years so I can share some perspective about a country as diverse as India. uh where and being in the AI impact summit, I I believe that AI or technology

specifically with in the shape of AI has the ability to reduce ex exclusion and uh support financial inclusion uh for a country where language uh culture um habits vary so much uh not just across

uh states or regions but also across the income levels across Ross different de demographics and you know at Mobyquake uh we are working very hard and we understand this responsibility because

uh you know we are one of the pioneers we are one of the early players in this ecosystem and we look at three different aspects uh when we look at increasing financial inclusion especially with AI

and the first one is uh around ease of use uh as you know in India uh you know most of the apps are currently still being used in English and digital. So we believe that this will give way uh to

conversations in the native language. Uh and that is something that can that is possible using AI. Uh secondly is around trust. Uh there is a lot of anxiety that users have when they use digital

products especially if they are not literate and AI has the capability to handle that reduce that anxiety increase the trust level so that they can use the products easily. And the third uh and

the most important thing is financial literacy uh which uh you know is very important for people to consume and use complex financial products uh which otherwise they cannot understand that

easily. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much uh Vib Pri and I'm going to jump straight here to Safia who's a co-founder of Karia for her perspective.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much under secretary sir. Um so I uh am the co-founder of Kadia and we're an impact focused uh data and AI services company uh all the way from data set building to

annotation um all the way to evaluations. And I think one of the things that actually my co-founder loves to say is that everyone in this room but most specifically I think people that

are living uh in low-income in rural communities are actually the best builders and beneficiaries of AI. But I think the problem that we have today is that we see those as two separate

things, right? We see on one hand workers, the builders of AI and on the other hand we have everyone else, those who might benefit. But I think what I want to position today and what I kind

of hope in our uh movement towards 2030 is that we start thinking of these two things together because when we think of someone as both a builder and a beneficiary, that is when we're able to

think about power and trust actually happening. Because if you're not able to be a part of the conversation from the very beginning, if people are not cluded included from the base of the value

chain in the bottom of the pyramid, then how can trust actually evolve? And more than that, by creating diversity in our inclusion, in our building, in our beneficiaries, we also must think about

language and cultural context because we don't want to be in a world where we have AI models that may be technically correct but don't actually help us. So, I think that's what I want to leave us

with. Let's think about how we can bridge the gap between builder and beneficiary and actually create a stage where people can have power and present their voices. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much Safia for exhorting us to avoid that dichotomy between builders and beneficiaries. Uh Surya Professor Ganguli if I may turn to you for a perspective from academia. You

know you bring together three very very interesting fields AI neurobiology and physics &gt;&gt; right. Um yeah so you know I I think one of the things that I worry a lot about

is the concentration of power and and wealth uh and AI capabilities in the hands of the of a few right uh you know there's maybe order four companies that are guiding the the the course of AI

development I could have been working at one of those company any of those companies probably but I chose to stay in academia because I cared very very much about the open dissemination of

scientific knowledge and uh knowledge that could be uh uh given to everybody in the world. Um now if you think about why AI has been so successful in the last decade, it's not been necessarily

because of the companies. They took us to the final mile but it was actually tons and tons of leg work that was done in academia and also open publishing in the companies. Imagine for example if

Google had never published its its famous paper attention is all you need the transformer. It was a pretty esoteric paper initially in machine translation but eventually that led to

alphafold and protein folding and drug discovery. So there's this compounding effect when we do science openly with the world and we share it and that compounding effect can be a major

driving force in stopping the inequality driven by AI adoption in the and AI power in the hands of the few. So what I really urge is strong public investment in in publicly funded AI generation.

Something like a CERN for AI. Uh you know particle physics was incredible. It had lots of spin-off effects in technology. But AI will have more if we decided to to um to collect our global

efforts to build a huge particle physics accelerator to drive um uh knowledge about the natural world to all of humanity. How much more could we achieve if we if we had public investment in AI

to spread it across the world? I think that would be fantastic. &gt;&gt; Fantastic for AI. Dorian, we heard that for the first time in 2017 at the AI for good summit.

Uh, thank you. Thank you very much. And Robert, I'm going to come to you now from for a perspective uh from the United Nations. UNDP is the leading actor on development on behalf of the

United Nations. So, how do you see the AI agenda and the STG's agenda coming together? &gt;&gt; No. Well, thank you very much and thanks for convening us uh at this really

interesting discussion. You know, I think one of the things if we just look globally at the situation of development, there is a defining character which is inequality.

And if we look at where the the potential benefits of AI can take us, there's no question economic and social progress uh can be, you know, accelerated by an incredible amount. But

where is that acceleration going to happen? And do we want a world where there are certain countries that are able to accelerate in incredible to levels of wealth and progress and

scientific uh achievement and so on and the diffusion model which villas mentioned in the last uh part of this discussion is is that really what we want we want trickle down. So when UNP

works with our countries worldwide and we're present in 170 countries, what we see are dramatically different levels of capacity and ability to actually embrace the benefits of AI and take on what is

uh out there. And so for us, we do think investment in ecosystems is actually really important. Um and those ecosystems are defined by things like of course getting the data right and data

governance and so on. Kind of unsexy topics, but even more so basic institutional capacity to be able to actually embrace and manage the the change that is going on out there. And

so this is where we're putting a lot of our effort in trying to understand those fundamentals and do it in a way that is inclusive. And we believe firmly that inclusion builds trust. And if we are

going to make progress on this globally and we are going to close that equity gap that is facing us now and is likely to get worse with the rapid introduction of AI, then we need to actually build

that trust as well. &gt;&gt; Thank you Rob. Thank you very much and thank you for our work together on digital public infrastructure. Claire, I'm come going to come to you now from

your current perspective and also if you wish from your previous perch. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much uh Amandep. Thank you Dorian. It's it's a real pleasure to be here and really glad like like Vas

really glad that so many people have chosen to come and listen to a longer term conversation about AI and development. One of the quite difficult topics um that we are that we're

thinking about this week. I mean, I think sometimes we're sort of prone sometimes in this discussion to see AI as a bit of a kind of brand new beginning, but I think it it is

important, particularly when we're thinking about inequality, to remember that AI is coming into a world which is already highly unequal. Um, and it is those sort of existing patterns of

inequality that have led to the, as Rob just said, the unequal patterns of adoption of AI that we're already seeing in the world. New technologies always create inequality. You know, not

everyone in the world is going to adopt a new equality on exactly the same hour of the same day. There's always going to be some inequality. The question in front of us is not is there in is there

going to be inequality in how people adopt AI. The question before us is is that inequality just a function of people adopting it at slightly different speeds or will or will they become

systemic and will some people be actually excluded in a more permanent structural way from the undoubted benefits that AI can bring. And I think that is the kind of policy the

investment question that we can define the answer to in this room in other rooms like it where decisions are made. And for me there are sort of three things. Oh my goodness 30 seconds and I

haven't even got to the point yet. Three um three things that we need to I love the second question on this on this um section. What do we need to do differently? That's where we need to

focus. And for me there are three things to think about. What incentives are we offering to AI developers, to policy makers, to researchers? What are the incentives that are created by our

policy frameworks that are created by our regulatory frameworks that are created by intern by global goals and other kind of global sess global so the incentives that people face the

investments that we put in ending inequality is not a cheap option. It's going to require investments, public sector but also private sector investments to get over some of those

structural balance structural issues. And thirdly, interoperability. How can we get over this problem of pilots of lots of small things happening which can help a tiny fraction of people

but to end these inequalities at scale we need to make sure that every that everything that we build is interoperable and contributes to the whole system.

Thank you Claire Osama. Okay, so I'm civil society. I'll take three minutes. [laughter] Extra population, right? Uh okay. So uh

as as usual civil society has more questions than solution, right? Uh uh so I I just uh wanted to bring three four things. One is that I was talking to this editor of Wired magazine about

three decades back and I asked what is the future of technology? He said the future of technology is biology. Uh so unless we understand the system of biology. So that's where I'm coming to.

Uh we got internet uh three decades back but now it is in the hands of just five companies. You know we got social media to connect the community but it it started disintegrating societies and

communities even democracies. Uh so every time the technology is pushed we start discussing about technological innovation as if that it will be changing the whole humanity. Even the

wheel is not used by 90% of the population of the world which is the biggest in innovation. And uh you know when I started researching on AI, I just have these things. I searched the

machine itself and I asked what are the virtues of uh you know AI and it said discrimination, hallucination, environmental degradation, exclusion, prejudice, algorithmic manipulation,

data mining, bias, inequalities, profiling, fabrication. So this is the virtues of the technologies that we are saying that it will save the world or make the world

efficient and therefore it's extremely important for all of us here is that even if we are going to use this technology as solving bit of a problem of the humanity what kind of the

safeguard that we should have you know and and and by 2030 if you are saying that beyond that what will be the future of SDGs and all that beyond that then all of us need to because all this

relate to social uh you know system of the society and therefore if we are using to go to technology and data in in that manner how do we do it that's that's my point

&gt;&gt; thank you Osama you brought the Pandora's box along okay minister I'm going to turn to you for the final reflections please &gt;&gt; thank you so

big challenges this and big risks. I I wrote a number of them and I'm going to try to be brief so I can say in time but definitely infrastructure 70 countries around the world have develop uh

deployed 5G a third in Latin America. So we cannot think of using utilizing AI if we don't even have the highway to deploy 5G I mean AI. So that is a big challenge for countries. The other one is software

speaks English and I come from a Spanish-sp speakaking country. So we must make sure that there must be a correlation or you know that we all communicate in the different languages

we all speak. But then we also think of data algorithms fit on data and I can say from a Latin American country we have a huge challenge on making sure that our data is not written on papers.

although I brought a paper uh that it's digitalized that it's standardized that the data is that the the the quality of the data is also good so we can fit algorithms and then AI can include

everybody not just the countries that have been doing the homework. Another risk or another challenge is AIdriven jobs displacement isn't just an economic challenge but it's a social and it's a

fiscal one. And I'm going to use Costa Rica's example. We're very proud of the fact that we provide universal health care health care system. But if you think of of the Asian population within

the last 15 years, Costa Rica's um life expectancy moved from 71 to 81 years of age, but also then think of the fertility rates. We stand 14 in the world as the lowest fertility rates in

the world. 1.3 uh children per family. OECD average is um 1.5. India is two kids per family. So that brings a lot of stress to our pension system. And the those are things

that we as governments need to think about and also then how what are we go how are we going to answer the job displacements with our population? Are we still going to think of fiveyear term

careers or should we be thinking of one year faster certifications? So all these people that will be displaced by AI then we can provide to them the necessary tools so they can go back to the

employment to employment and then fit into our pension system. It's all a loop and those are serious risks that we as governments need to sit down and think how are we going to utilize AI to make

sure that we jump into the wagon of economic development. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Minister and a big thank you to all of you for making such excellent points and on time. So we have

uh actually a minute left and Dorin and I are not going to attempt any summing up. So 30 second remarks. I just want to say you know uh some words that have kind of you know hopefully stay they

stay with all of you. Uh AI diffusion cannot be trickled down. We need to transform systems at scale and uh this should not be just seen as another uh tech wave. uh and we should be mindful

of some of those consequences. So let me hand it back to Dorene for her final uh reflections and thank you again. Um thank you thank you Amadib and and thank you to uh our amazing our amazing

panelists just very quickly building on uh on your comments Amadep just to add um a few other points that I was hearing of course the importance of political will uh the importance of that

infrastructure the investment in that infrastructure the importance of developing the local ecosystems with context in mind linguistic cultural the skilling piece you mentioned also the

financial literacy piece also so critical Rob that institutional capacity piece I think is is sometimes overlooked and of course keeping people at the center something that we have to

keep in mind in all of our discussions and with that it will help us to unlock uh potential uh to impact lives and livelihoods. I think also that that builders and beneficiary piece was uh

was was certainly an important one and of course um responsibility we have to keep responsibility in focus. uh also I'm if I can mention I think these deliberations will also help as we look

forward to July uh with the global dialogue fast approaching the ITU AI for good also taking place backtoback and also the world summit on the information society forum because I think all of

these roads actually intersect but thank you so much and I hand back to you Amad thanks &gt;&gt; thank you everyone thank you for prioritizing this topic and thank you to

our esteemed panelists taking time out. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you panelists. May I request all of our speakers to please ascend the

stage? We have a mentors for you. And to the audience, I'd just like to point out that this panel is quite like a microcosm of the summit itself. It had civil society, it had industry, it had

policy professionals, it had government. it had such robust participation from every vantage point that we're looking to cover um in this summit and in our participatory governance approach. So,

thank you so much for this very interesting session. We'd just like to give away a few momentos. [applause and cheering] Yeah,

&gt;&gt; I like a good message. Oh, &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; [music]
