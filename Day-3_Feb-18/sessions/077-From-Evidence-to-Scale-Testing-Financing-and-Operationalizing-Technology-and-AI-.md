## 📝 Transcript

How you doing? India. Chicken blessings. change.

I was there. That's my dad's name. Stop. &gt;&gt; I want to make sure I have it right. already

know. Hello, good morning everyone. Good afternoon. So uh I hand it over uh to moderator to proceed this session please.

&gt;&gt; Hi everyone. A very good afternoon. As we start this session, I'd first like to welcome everybody. Thank you for your time and for coming. Um I will formally introduce the session and all our

panelists. But before that maybe I could invite our very esteemed colleagues to join me on the stage. Um so with us we have very enriching and very um senior panel members. At the beginning I'd like

to invite the government of India representative Dr. V. Ana Nageshwarin the chief economic advisor to the government of India. Next I'd like to invite on stage Dr. Wo

mto from FAO who's the director of innovation. With them we also have with us Brenda Mulele Gund who is the ICT4D global lead for EAD.

If we can have a round of applause for our panelists please. Thank you. And after that with us from the world food program we have the chief data officer Megan Naidu. Please join us on

stage sir. And then last Dr. Indran a Naidu who is the director for the independent office of evaluation of EAD. &gt;&gt; I will take the mic.

&gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Okay. Before we formally start the organizers would like to take a formal picture. If I can please request the panel members to come to the front. You

need me to go there. Can I start first? All right. Well, they're finding a handheld mic for me. So, until then, &gt;&gt; for farmers, weather is everything.

Rainfall, heat, humidity, and wind determine when to plant, when to harvest, and how to protect livestock and fish. Through the life ND project, farmers now access weather specific

agricultural advice using farmer chat develop. &gt;&gt; Okay. It is an AI summit. It doesn't mean we will not have technological issues.

Thank you for bearing with us. And with that we will formally start and at some point I will sit there when we find a mic. Um if we can start if the panel is okay with it.

Okay. Namaste, namaskarum, good afternoon and a very warm welcome to everybody that's joined us. We're very happy to have you here and we are very happy to have this panel. My name is

Vashnavi Pavitran. I'm the global technology partnerships manager for the UN World Food Program. It's my absolute pleasure and honor to host and moderate this panel and I'm from India. So it's

very special for me to be back on home ground to do this. Today we are here to discuss from evidence to scale testing financing and operationalizing tech and AI for humanitarian and development

action. That's a very long title, right? So, what does it actually mean? What are we looking to do here in the next hour? Um, in line with the AI India summit to move from dialogue to impact. When we

were designing this event, we really wanted to focus on seeing how this dialogue can be actually about impact instead of just talking about it. So, what is already

[snorts] Okay, now I can sit down. So what is already happening on ground? What are we doing? What are we seeing? How are we learning from that? And that's really

the questions we are looking to deep dive into the next hour and seeing how all of these different pieces fit together from financing to pilots to evidence to seeing how the governance

and policy of this works. And we really want to focus on seeing what we are seeing on ground and what we learning from it. This event is co-hosted and organized by the three Rome based

agencies. Thank you. The three Rome based agencies which is the UN World Food Program. It's the largest humanitarian organization that is out there. You have then FAO, the Food and

Agriculture Organization, who is actually all of the research and think tank and the brains behind a lot of what we see in agriculture and in food systems. And last, the International

Fund for Agricultural Development, EHAD, which is an IFI, actually an international financial institution, a specialized UN agency that really looks at unlocking finances for inclusive and

sustainable uh development. Together, they're called the Rome based agencies because they're based in Rome. But we also share the common mission of food security, hunger, nutrition, and

agricultural development. So together we work on SDG2 which is zero hunger. With that as I was mentioning we have a very esteemed panel and actually as we were designing this we were really looking

for people that have worked on ground across a wide range of expertise and you will see that as I introduce them. But we know we got this 12:30 slot where some of you will be a little hungry. So,

instead of just doing introductions, I'm going to put our panelists on the spot a little bit and ask them a 30- secondond rapid fire. What we wanted to do was give you a little bit of a flavor,

something personal, hear their thoughts outside their designations, and then we'll get into the panel discussion. So, if I can have some support to put up a 30- secondond clock on the on the screen

and maybe put them on the hotspot. I will start with introducing our chief economic advisor Dr. V. Anantaeshwarin. To be honest, he's the person who needs the least introduction in this context.

Our 18th um economic advisor. He has been in the term since 2022. A writer, a teacher. I actually used to read his columns on the mint. So, I'm fangirling a little bit. The seating arrangement

was not biased at all. And as we look at you sir um I think one of the things that was very interesting and why we're very honored to have you here for the national economic survey that was just

out two weeks back for the first time in India we actually have a dedicated chapter on AI and I think this has been quite incredible and there is a lot of thought there in terms of what we are

looking to do and we will delve into it in the panel But my rapid fire for you. Earlier at this summit this week, you were speaking about the future of employability and how AI should be used

for educational reform. And so I'm wondering in a world where AI can produce at a fraction of cost and effort of what the human takes, is there actually still value for the human

experience that you think about? &gt;&gt; Uh undoubtedly yes. No, no, I'm still giving you 30 seconds. I'm just checking your mic. It's good. &gt;&gt; Yeah, undoubtedly. Yes. I think uh just

as in software, garbage in, garbage out, the kind of output and involvement you get from AI will also depend on how rich and how deep your prompts are. So, I think the more you read, the better you

will be in using AI. &gt;&gt; So, solid and way under 30 seconds. Think about that for efficiency. Thank you for setting the tone for the rest of the panel. Next, we have Dr. Wanso

Merto. He's the director of innovation at FAO, responsible for leading the innovation agenda. He joins us with over 28 years of experience in research and policy and is very passionate about the

agri food systems. He's also served as the UN resident coordinator in the Republic of Guinea and as the representative in China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Um, Wanso,

we speak a lot about the positives of AI and you've discussed this at various forums in the last couple of years. I'm wondering if AI did not exist today, what would be the biggest loss we would

face? &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much. uh I think we would lose speed, we would lose precision and we would lose foresight which are three key and essentials

capabilities for doing advanced scientific research. So I really have the feeling that uh without AI today uh we would miss some major discovery. I'm thinking of uh new vaccines, new

therapies, treating infectious diseases, early warning systems and uh and this would really affect our capacity to really respond to these exponential challenges we are facing. So we need AI

powered solution that really are commensurate to the magnitude of the problems we are trying to solve today. &gt;&gt; Well said. Couldn't agree more. And next we have Brenda Mulele Gund who's the

global lead for ICT40 for EAD. Before that she's worked with uh UNICEF as the ICT chief and also comes from a very strong NGO and Cso background. She's worked for over 11 years with World

Vision started with action. It's so nice to have you with us with all your experience across multiple countries in Asia and Africa. You've really been leading ICT leadership and digital

transformation. But my question for you, I've stalked your LinkedIn a little bit. You travel a lot and I'm wondering in this travel, what is an AI application you've used

personally, including maybe this week. Can you tell us? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks so much. Uh, I've used Chad GBT. Uh, but it's not chibbity to write my

notes. Um I'm I'm so curious how Chad Gibbti has transformed quickly with image processing. So I put up this image and said can you create my photo close to this Greek philosopher sitting up on

a on a leg and talking about how it is important to make transitions and ChibiT took my photo. I was standing made it sit down like in almost live form. I was like this is interesting right? So I I

love take I'm a I'm a geek. Um so it's very interesting to see how chi is actually transforming. &gt;&gt; Very good to know. So we can photoshop some very senior people into this panel

too. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And next we have Megan Naidu who's the chief data officer for WFP. I've had the pleasure to work with him over the last year. He's actually our first ever chief

data officer who joined us in 2023. Under his leadership, we've developed and published the first ever WFP global data strategy and launched the artificial intelligence strategy for the

first time too. PreWFP, he comes from extensive private sector background. He used to be the country leader for AWS in South Africa. And while I have spoken about the strategies, I must say so much

of our work is on implementation and we will get into that. Um but across all of these industries that you worked at, what is one myth about AI that you encounter in your job? We hear too much

WhatsApp forwards. So why don't you tell us a myth you've encountered and what it looks like? &gt;&gt; Thanks very much Vishnami. You mean AI is real, right? So I guess the the thing

I find most that I come across is when people think of AI and its use of solving problems, they see it as some kind of magic that can think solve it in a vacuum and the reality is it needs

good reliable data. It needs human expertise and it needs investment in time in training it. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I appreciate it. Um and last we have Dr. Indran A Naidu who is the

director of the independent office of evaluation of Ephad. I've had the pleasure to interact with him a few times and I must say he's one of the most passionate people I have met on

evaluation and respecting the independence of evaluation. So very happy you could join us. Um, prior to this he used to be the director of independent evaluation for UNDP and he's

held other roles across the UN in senior management and in South Africa. Um, I think one thing to note as I was saying his career really shows the evaluation function focus having um engaged and

produced more than 150 country and corporate evaluations and I'm sure we'll benefit from that in this panel. Um my question for you Indran, if you had to narrow it down, what is the biggest

benefit of AI that you're seeing today at an individual level for every normal person out there? &gt;&gt; Thank you very much Vashnath and happy to be here. Uh I think AI broadly it's

it has an ability to provide multiple and simultaneous benefits to a range of actors all of which are mutually reinforcing. There's three tiers I talk about. One is the community and

individual. the individuals within the community that provides high quality information. It democratizes them and it also leads to a it's really a boon for democracy as prime minister Modi has

said all inclusive. So it helps with inclusivity. The second tier would be government and agencies such as IFAD who really are trying to enhance an intervention. This provides them with

customized information to come up with customized findings and customized solutions. One of the challenges any researcher would know the gap between research and implementation. So this can

become much more focused and in agriculture it definitely needs to be sustainable. As an evaluator we now have access to broader deeper information which helps us to triangulate more in a

more sophisticated way better findings but importantly more customized recommendations. So in essence it's an assisted technology cannot exclude human beings but it's a tool that makes us a

lot more productive. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And can we have a round of applause for them actually doing it in 30 seconds. Now we move into the actual panel

discussion. And I just want to tell the audience this is not just about them or me asking them questions. We actually have some time for you to ask questions. So we would really appreciate that you

come and engage with us. And this is a two-way dialogue that takes place. But I will kickstart. Um so maybe I can start with you. Um and as I was saying when I was reading this national economic

survey I found it very interesting that there is an argument for a third way of AI regulation not marketled the way we see it in the US not regulatoryheavy as we see in Europe but that there is a

bottoms up approach that we can take and I feel like at the UN and at the government we often discuss policy first implementation second and for the first time we're kind of saying no let Let's

discuss what are the real cases. I see you smiling so I feel I read it correctly. Um so my question given the fast-paced nature um of AI how dynamic it is from a government perspective what

are policy implications for regulating AI and what is the role of the government in facilitating AI for the public sector? &gt;&gt; Okay thank you. Thank you Vishnavi. I

think um the given the limited time we have apart from nudging apart from nudging everybody here to read the chapter in the economic survey I'll just give a quick bird's eye view of what are

the implications for regulating a first it's important to uh get sequencing right more than the speed of regulation right so there is need for a phased approach and the second is regulation

cannot be omnibus it has to be riskbased or proportionate regulation. The third thing is the technofudal challenge. In other words, uh regulators have to understand that they have a

democratic obligation to the public and therefore they have to make sure that the market concentration risk and the balance of power between the AI companies and the public is always kept

in mind. And number four, the labor market sensitivity by design. And that is true for a lot of global south countries because we just don't want to create a social instability problem in

the name of productivity gains because who gets to share the fruits of productivity will ultimately matter for for the society and the economy. And we also said that um there has to be an AI

economic council. We wrote about it in the economic survey because it is not a problem of only compute, data, privacy or security. It has got socioeconomic implications. So countries have to have

crosscutting interministerial body called an AI economic council. You can label it differently and then that will be necessary to govern AI in the interest of society. We should not let

only technologist determine the AI regulation policy and data governance matters. And then when it comes to uh uh preparing the public to operate in the world of AI and also outside of AI,

foundational skills will matter much more than technical training. So what kind of education we impart to our students and our youngsters will be an important part of regulation. So these

are the seven elements of dealing with AI from a policy perspective. Back to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. was excellently summarized and you all got a sneak peek of the

chapter two in there. Um let me turn to W on given the very close relationship between AI and innovation was why we really wanted to hear your perspective

on how you see AI playing a role in streamlining innovation. Are you leveraging AI and scaling innovation to create value for the field? Over to you. Yeah, thank you for thank you for the

question. I must say although AI is not the silver bullet. Uh the answer to your question is yes, we are leveraging AI for mainstreaming and scaling innovation across our organization. I think that's

just something that nobody can avoid uh in this uh uh time of of history. I would like to give you two examples on the way uh FAO is using artificial intelligence. Um so the first one is uh

to make global knowledge uh accessible and actionable. Um but first let me tell you one thing is that the fact is that we are not uh I mean the biggest challenge I would say for scaling is not

a lack of solutions. It's not a lack of solution, but it's more um a lack of opportunity for connecting people and stakeholders together in order for them to have access to this information.

So, uh what is important to uh to remember is uh uh we need to find solutions based on AI that are accessible and affordable. Because when I'm thinking of low and

middle inome countries in most of these countries they are left behind in terms of being able to use some of these technologies. So the role of FAO is really to to close this gap and making

sure that all these new technologies are accessible and affordable. And to fill this gap, FAO has launched an initiative which is called the IBI food system technology and innovation outlook at a

food system technology and innovation outlook which is the first ever global database on technologies and innovations. So innovations on a broad sense for agri food system

transformation and we are using AI to uh you know to scan the uh uh different uh reliable data sources and be able to to to bring together these huge sources of information on technologies and

innovation. It has been launched recently at our science and innovation forum and it's accessible through our science technology and innovation portal. So my first point was how do we

make this I mean scaling means making this technology innovation accessible and affordable for people and first of all you need to know what they are in which context they work and in which

context they don't they do not work the second way we are using AI in FAO uh is uh uh we've been introducing what we call a portfolio sense making and management of innovations that is to say

before and especially before AI we were innovating ing. We had solutions that were being promoted or uh catalyzed and scale all over the world but we didn't have a perfect vision of what were these

solutions what are the most impactful how can we learn from these solutions and what are the one that we would like to scale thanks to AI today we are able to analyze massive massive uh uh number

of data reports final reports of projects and thanks to that we now have a clear vision of what FAO's portfolios of innovation and technologies by thematic area in livestock in forestry

in one in health uh etc etc. So we do have now this vision which help us to uh identify what are the most promising solutions uh what are the ones that needs scaling through policy through

investment and so on and so forth but also for us to be more strategic in where do we want to invest our resources and what is the most needed again for small order farmers to have access to

this technology so that's a second area where we are having this portfolio management which uh without AI would have taken months and years. I just would like to

add one more point which is a lot of things we are doing in terms of mainstreaming and scaling is non AI related and I think it's important to make this point. I mean we will all

agree on that and I think uh uh you mentioned it just before the human dimension and the values we bring into this uh into this AI powered solutions is absolutely essential and we cannot

say we were not warned that there are a lot of risk associated to AI. We've been warned by all the top leaders of the world. So as a United Nations, we really want to hold these principles and this

value very very high and uh and make sure that whatever we do is inclusive and that we are using soft skills, social relationships, networking, behavioral design to make sure that

these technologies can reach the one who most need it. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I was very sure that between the Rome based agencies they would be sync because we collaborate a lot

together but it's great to see the sync with the government and seeing that flow and I want to pick up on something you said on making these solutions accessible and affordable and money

brings me to Brenda to your question um we really can't move anything from dialogue to impact without funding and money and as AI adoption shifts from pilot projects to scalable across

countries. What are how are countries approaching structural financing for AI or digital innovation rather? What are investment instruments that maybe EHAD is looking at that will unlock inclusive

and sustainable AI adoption in rural areas especially. Over to you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh thank you for for that question. Um I want us to first imagine the road network. When we walk on the

roads, we can take it for granted that there are roads and we drive our cars in it. But if we look at the road network, it has been developed and financed by governments. Governments put money, they

build a road network. But you'll never find a government that also runs a car dealership and they also provide the cars, right? So it means the cards are provided by people as ourselves and

private sector and anybody else who wants to develop cars. So with that in mind, I want us to transform the same image that we have roads and cars into now AI and how it transforms into

implementation. Government responsibility is the development of what we calling digital public infrastructure. The role of digital public infrastructure, there's

several pieces in it. There's the element of farmer registries. The data of the farmer. Who is the farmer? Where they are? What are they growing? And what are they producing? Where are they

selling? That's the first data. Then we have got the other element which is interpolability. What do we mean by that? Systems that speak to one another. Government speaks to me. I hear what

they're speaking is the same language. We're hearing it the same way. That's interpolability. Then we have the data governance and policy. I think that has been mentioned. Then we have digital

payments. the things that we when we look at them we may not see the connection digital payments and identity when you are able to pay something by a phone there's a data that every of those

systems are speaking to for you to be able to have a seamless uh payment then you have the delivery extension delivery so that's systems and infrastructure that's a role of government to produce

the enabling environment now we have the other piece now that government has done the public service. We need now to look at what are some of the key things that can be put on top of it. And we have

good examples where we have agri stack uh that the India government has has worked on. We have kameis that the Kenyan government has worked on. We have also uh ages that uh Rwanda government

and we have several examples why government is doing that. But why are they putting money into all those things? Building that foundational services is important for private sector

investment. Now why is private sector important? Because if we're looking at the digital services, the AI models, the different services that are being built currently for the agriculture sector,

these are being innovated by private sector. Private sector is the one that is building and build bringing cars on the road network. Now why are we asking private sector to be part and parcel of

the P is because we want to drive at scale. I think that's the question you're asking me. Why are things moving from pilot to now as a core infrastructure is because there is a

connection between what government plays and the role that also uh private sector plays. Now there are shifts that are happening within the financing space we which I'm calling financing logic. The

logic is that governments before were not borrowing for what we're calling soft infrastructure. soft infrastructure is AI systems uh you know but now they're paying attention say we need to

be able to finance the things so they are able to work with institutions like IFAD they institutions like World Bank and others to actually put investments into digital public infrastructure

because they know that's how it's going to unlock the private sector that's when it's going to bring in the cars the other aspect is that when you look at systems uh for digital public uh

services no matter how flushy the car is, no matter how you know innovative it is if there's no road to drive it, it becomes useless. Right? So the reason why we're saying this is very important

for us to connect the dots as if I say we are looking at public money but that public money is supposed to unlock private investment. That's how the the dots connect. So and then the other part

is that people can be asking why are we not using donor money for this? Why can't we just take a grant and put it in in that? Grants have taken us into pilots. But we cannot use grants for

scale. We cannot take donor money and say we are scaling through donor money because donor money is projectized. It ends at a certain point in time. After that the question is who supposed to

take this forward? So the reason why we are shifting the finance logic and say let government um put resources into the digital public infrastructure. Let's unlock and derisk private sector

investment is because we want a road network and cars that that work. The other part that also we need to look at the question you're asking about the different instruments is that as if we

work with both sovereign instruments but also in what we call non-s sovereign instruments. Non- sovereign instruments are private. So the sovereign instruments are going to support

building the roads and everything else while the the other non-s sovereign are the ones that are going to help us to what we call blended catalytic investment. This is the private sector

combination with public sector together all this is what is going to take us from pilots into scale. So answering your question going back to the road now we have the road then we have the right

cars that are going to drive the road that's the analogy that we can scale AI without it we can't go for any far thank you &gt;&gt; thank you and such a great analogy to

make it so simple to understand too um with that now that we know how we can get the money and build the roads um let's turn to Megan to understand how are we actually operationalizing this on

the ground can Can you tell us with some examples how this is benefiting field operations? Over to you. &gt;&gt; Thanks Bashi. Really good question, right? Because if we do all of this, we

got to ask ourselves why and what to what end. So in in the world food program, it's very much about field focus, country first and how we make impact, real impact on the ground

through AI interventions. We have many examples and many areas that we've deployed AI because we look at it quite holistically. But some of the areas to share the first

one really around food security. Food security we're using that uh AI technology to optimize our supply chain routes so that we get food out faster more optimally and basically get food to

the right place to the right people at the right time. So that drives efficiency in our operations. We're also using artificial intelligence to build food resilience into local communities

where we use AI and local data such as soil samples to help the local community to get the best possible crop yield then to build uh you know independence into the community over time. The other area

we're using AI effectively is uh in emergency response which is you know the other uh part of what WFP does. uh in terms of using artificial intelligence to respond better to floods or droughts

which then allow us to get ahead of the curve. That we position ourselves u you know with some forewarning and get more to a point where we can respond proactively as opposed to reactively

where we can get a front of the uh emergency situation position our food supplies ahead of the crisis and therefore get uh aid out more effectively. We're also using drone and

satellite imagery to assist in search and rescue operations where we can use the very scarce resources to optimally uh rescue people and actually those two solutions themselves come together where

we're using AI which is perhaps invisible in some ways but has impact to the front lines where we're using things like aentic AI to build solutions faster at lower cost which then makes it

cheaper to the field operations and therefore all drives our cost to serve down giving us that much more impact on the front lines. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So now we have the money the

pilots what's working on grout the policy all of it but what are we already learning from this? Um with that I turn to you Indran given AI is a newer space as the director of evaluation how are we

approaching the evaluation of AI program themselves and I'm also curious if you're using AI in your own team or work in evidence collection and evaluation processes to help.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much Vajnath. So the question is answered from two fronts. One, we are using AI in independent evaluation to have a better story, a better narrative to promote learning. Uh

we need to recognize that evaluation tends to historically work on samples. They can be quite limited size. With AI, we able to sample broader, increase the scale, the depth, and the scope. So

hopefully the information that is coming in is more reliable. We've dealt with the issue of variability. That's the first point. Secondly, AI actually reduces our research costs and that time

now can be better used the information to produce analysis that is also deeper and more customized. I think anyone who reads evaluation reports often has a fair criticism. You are telling us what

you know and your recommendations are too generalized. Now we need to recognize this differentiation especially in the rural sector and generalized recommendations will not

bring about overall solutions. So my office is using it strongly. We have uh AI functionality. We also share our lessons within the group called the evaluation corporation group which are

the heads of evaluation of the MDBs uh which we serve on and that has seriously reduced our cost but also improved our efficiency. But we take a view that the human being cannot be left out. So we

need to also guard against bias because if you get it wrong, you actually amplify the bias. That's point one. Point two, part of my responsibility is to evaluate independently IFAD and

report on IFAD's performance to government around the world. That's why I'm also having uh a series of simultaneous meetings in in Delhi here. But then also to tell the board and the

funders how IAD is performing. Now in the new program the India country program my colleague Mark is over here we have AI as a component. I just looked back 2010 2016 there was no AI mentioned

in the country strategy programs of India and all the other countries that this office which is evaluating for 20 uh 20 some odd years is doing. So now we are looking at the intervention the

claim and what have happened on the ground. When it comes to happen what on the ground we assess whether the AI intervention the application that IAD is supporting governments with is it

relevant sustainable efficient transparent impactful what is the scale so that's the second part that comes in so when we look at AI I would urge everyone to still look at it according

to the criteria relevance efficiency impact and impact even more but impact for overall scale we don't have the results yet because it's new, but I'm quite sure that in years to come, the

assessment of IOA of AI intervention would be quite interesting. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. I'm sure we'll have a follow-up panel a few years from now where we're discussing all of this in

reflection. Thank you to all the panelists for some very interesting feedback and something that I think really grounds how AI is being looked at outside of all of the strategic

discussions. Now we turn to you audience who very patiently heard us out and engaged with us. We'd love to open the floor for any questions that may be there. Yes, please. I have a hand up.

&gt;&gt; If you can please state your name and then please ask us the question. Sir. Hello, my name is Subash. I am from the energy sector in India working with the public sector for the last 25 years and

I'm hearing Dr. Nageshan our chief economic advisor on the various forums about the economic situation in India. Now it is a very very uh informative session today giving the broad policy

decision on the AI impact on Indian d Indian scenario. Now my question is because I'm from the public sector in the previous session also it was on the public sector but nobody from the public

sector was there. So now my question since our economic advisor here from the government of India the public sector in India are on majority major are from the power sector

from the steel industry from the fertilizer sector, oil and gas sector, infrastructure and then health sector and then all small defense sector. These are the public sector. Now they have got

their different entity of their own expertise having that different uh across the domain they are working independently. &gt;&gt; Yes.

&gt;&gt; And you have very correctly said that Vashi that public sector you touched &gt;&gt; uh in the interest of time can you please come to the question quickly? &gt;&gt; My question is that is there any

government policy for the public sector with service AI systems applicable to the public sector? Thank you. There is no specific policy for public sector enterprises. Each sector I think Mr.

Naidu spoke about relevance, impact uh effectiveness etc. So obviously the relevance, efficiency and impact will differ from sector to sector. The ministry of electronics and information

will lay out the broad policy framework but then each uh uh sector or the enterprise will have to evaluate it from the point of view of their cost and benefits. For example, the financial

sector regulators both RBI and SEBI have put out working papers on how AI can help in the respective financial sector. What kind of safeguards that institutions need to have when they sell

products to CL individuals uh whether it is insurance or capital markets etc and how they are using AI to uh understand their trading pattern and they have an obligation to inform the the the clients

the investors etc. So like that in the finance sector there is a different application. So it's important to lay out a policy framework very in very broad term which is what matey is doing

but then later it's up to each ministry and each enterprise therefore to come up with policies that are very tailor made for their specific situations. You it's not necessary to have one omnibus policy

that should be only at a very uh uh what shall I say very macro level. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I'm going to put my hat back for rapid fire. Please be super quick so we can take more questions. I see a

person and then we'll come back to you ma'am. Uh ma'am if you can please ask your question. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh I am Mangula Praep. I represent a civil society organization. I just

wanted to uh ask a question about when we are saying that we the SDG goal 2 and the larger goal of SDG saying we want don't want to leave anyone behind. How can AI ensure that there is uh zero

poverty because zero poverty is a very uh optimistic uh goal which we are saying because I just wanted to understand how we you you have made a very wonderful presentation by all the

panelists but how does we uh the AI will be able to help to address extreme poverty because uh in across like in mainly in Asia and in Africa we do have large starvation deaths and other issues

relating to extreme poverty. So I just wanted to have &gt;&gt; I have that answer. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the question. I would turn to our RBA colleagues. I can any hands

up or I can shoot the question. Please go ahead. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; I'll go. Thank you. I'll go first because that question connects directly

to our goal of solving for world hunger at the World Food Program. So we see a lot of promise in AI in helping accelerate solving for the pro problem of zero hunger. It cannot solve it

itself. I think there's a lot of components around it that that will help solve it. But what it can do is help close the gap faster. And some of what I mentioned which is building food

resilience into communities where you can you know shift away from where organizations need to fund them or provide food and that's that's the type of solutions we need to converge on

because solving for hunger is a moving target. So I think if we keep trying to solve it the way we are, it will always be a moving target. So we need to start thinking differently. How do we actually

push AI into the local communities where they then can selfs serve and close that gap much faster? &gt;&gt; Thanks Megan. Uh on I saw did you want to compliment?

&gt;&gt; Yeah maybe um uh rapidly. I think uh this is what we were saying just before it's uh we need to be inclusive in the design of these solutions and uh and in the previous panel uh we had a

colleagues from UNDP was mentioning if you create an AI solution that doesn't help delivering vaccine faster uh or you know producing something for smaller farmers in our case then we are not

interested so it means that uh in the design uh of these solutions we have to be very intentional and making sure that uh it's humanentric trick it's designed around the people who really need it and

this is where I think public le innovation is so important in this context &gt;&gt; well said completely agree I see that you had a question ma'am please

&gt;&gt; yeah namaste I ma desai from sea uh we work with the small and marginal women farmers and we have also uh piloted the AI application uh for the small farmer women farmers uh what our experience Ian

says that of course the technology is costly uh for the small and marginal and specifically women farmers where uh the women are have facing structural cultural barriers to access finance and

second is the subscription once even if if that is a blended pool of finance they get access it but the regular subscription is also very high to maintain the cost. So the uh when we

talk about pilot and expansion we are facing the challenge. So is there any solution that Ephad Fo WFP or the government is doing so that we can take to the women's small and marginal

farmers. Thank you. &gt;&gt; I will shoot this question to Brenda on how if you want to start. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um there are quite interesting things that we have seen. Um most of the

studies that you find out there they would say that women are less adopters of technology but I'll tell you that that is not usually the case. Women are early adopters of technology. They they

easily adopt technology. They easily um you know understand it and then they easily train others. Um the challenge that you're talking about when you're talking about inequalities and and

digital divide and and all these other elements is also one you're looking at from the literacy perspective. You're also looking at from the access perspective and looking at from the

supply perspective. Key things that women farmers need. Um can they be able to access markets? Um and then they able to access those markets on time. can they be able to access finance so that

that finance can be able to propel them to you know better produce and also make better income for their families. When it comes to technology, one of the key things that we look at um not only just

addressing the literacy but also addressing the access issues and also ensuring that we addressing the supply of of those technologies. Um one is are these technologies able to work in the

rural communities as if and we are a rural development agency. uh so we ask the questions how do we make all these technologies available for the rural communities AI if we see it most of it

is running on applications maybe WhatsApp they're running on that need a smartphone but if we're able to ask ourel can we be able to take this technology and make a what we call

backward compatibility and be able to provide the same service on a feature phone those are the things that women need so that they can be able to access technology the other aspect is the

delivery mechanism of women institutions um ensuring that women can be able to come together learn the technology as a community and to be able to share that knowledge also as a community um we've

seen I think our colleagues in Arabs where they about farmer field schools where women are coming together uh in a group and they'll be able to learn the technology so the delivery mechanisms

has to be those that address access issues but also ensuring that we're able to allow women to al access markets to be able to sell the produce at the same time also address the literacy

challenges So it's a full circle of how we address all this all these challenges on women. &gt;&gt; Thank you Brenda. Yes, I see another question and then we'll come to you sir.

5 minutes. So I will really request that now we start going rapid fire. Hello. Hi. Good afternoon everyone. I am Shel founder of Shell Copter Academy. So Shell Copter Academy is Northeast

India's first platform where we teach northeastern Indian women how to create content online using AI. Uh as a fellow Northeastern uh I have a I had the privilege of having the access to fresh

organic food. So my question is if ultrarocessed food is cheaper because the system is optimized for it and AI optimizes system even further, how do we prevent AI from reinforcing the very

inequalities that make fresh organic food a privilege? &gt;&gt; Great question. Reminding me of Black Mirror a little bit there. Um I will turn to ono or

&gt;&gt; I would love to know the answer to the question. We would love to know the answer to the question is what I'm having from the panel. At least we have a humble panel here. Um, anybody who

would like to take it please. Brenda, one for the team. &gt;&gt; I'll try it. Um, so we're looking at organic being a privilege. I come from Malawi. All right. In Malawi, the way we

produce, if we didn't have technologies that have to look at traceability, we produce organically and naturally. All right. But the cover of the indicators of what entails something to be organic

and because it has been said is organic then it becomes premium. My question to you would be it's not about making it you know elites. How do we change the narrative for the women that produce

things organically so that they can be able to access markets at a premium price and address inequalities when it comes to pricing and also in terms of the income that the women generate? If

we're able to answer that question, then we go back and say how do we make all the systems and indicators of traceability and all the elements to be able to be beneficial for small holder

farmers. So I we have to have this conversation. I don't think that we are the best. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I I think we concur. That's a very good response. It was a good one for that. We

weren't sure when we started but I think we landed very well on that one. I see you had your hand up. Please you're next. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh myself is Vin Singh from

FO. My questions to all of you. uh like there are a lot of advisories to the farmers based on the AI and also on the 16 I visited Bmand there are plenty of advisory what are the mechanism as a

farmer I get many messages on pest control advisories on cultivations best practices how is there any mechanism to control that which one should I trust as a farmer

so that is question &gt;&gt; thank you for the question and it is true we are in an era where we're getting bombarded with all sorts of different information how do you know

what's true and what's not another googly hey this panel is really being tested what's so I see you take some initiative can I shoot it to you &gt;&gt; I'm replying to my FAO colleague so

[laughter] we we are working on that actually and I think one of the central uh question and it it's also related to what Brena was saying is about the uh the data quality

and the data governance And we still haven't cracked completely this uh issue but is the most important one and in the FO projects where we are trying to strengthen advisory services through AI

what we are doing is uh I mean we are working with national data set it's not just all the data from the world we are using to train the model we are using very specific data set which are which

are um I mean which are relevant to the uh the local places where the farmers will access these uh these services. So we are really uh working on this uh data governance to make sure that we are not

increasing biases and that the information that is provided to farmers is just uh uh the right one. So I think this is this is something we have already kind of uh uh solved in some

ways when you do it in a kind of localized context. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; If I may say something quickly um when you're asking about the rapid question

you said the base what did you use? I said I use charge. I wouldn't say take charge and give it to a smaller farmer. Why? Yes, it can answer questions but that information is not curated. It's

not vated. It is not, you know, informed. It's informed by so many data. It's like you are there on the prayground and everybody tells you everything and you're just taking it.

The motors that you're seeing smaller farmers use are curated information. researchers, extension advisors are putting that content together to actually to address um and provide

digital advisor services to smaller farmers. But there will still be the element of fatigue because farmers have this app for something, have this app for something. The reason why we are

coming together and say let's work together and as RBAs is that can we be able to democratize data so that within that we can now provide services to small holder farmers with one source of

truth and that's something that also the India government is is doing well. I think we commend them for the visa project that's just being launched. I think that's one of the um you know

solutions to this. So don't take charge I give it mafir. I think at this point I see a big flashing red times up but I've been said we have one last question we can take so

if you can keep it very short please that would be great. &gt;&gt; Uh namaste panel my name is Push Kanal I'm from EAD so uh my question is actually to Dr. Nagiswaran and I want to

move away from the application of uh AI to the infrastructure part just to understand that uh with the increasing computing capacity required for AI uh we also need to develop the infrastructure.

Now for that in India are we planning that the benefit of it can also be availed by the tier 2 or tier three three cities or rather the remote areas uh especially for example the hilly

states in India which also pro have natural advantage of providing a temperature control. So do we have any program or initiative uh that can incentivize these states uh to uh start

building these data centers? It's a it's a good question and answer has to be nuanced and given the time it may be too brief an answer. Uh infrastructure as you correctly pointed out may have to be

located in loc areas where geographically it is compatible but the AI capabilities can be dispersed. That is why the five centers of AI excellence that the government of India announced

in the last budget have been well dispersed and then the talent ecosystem for AI can also emerge in different places. It's like saying a semiconductor chip manufacturing mission. The actual

fab may have to be located in areas where there is plenty of water, good temperature, financing, everything. But assembly, testing, packaging, design, everything can be dispersed. So the way

to look at it is not look at it as only as where the data centers are located, but in terms of the entire ecosystem and there there is a dispersed uh approach to AI infrastructure if I take it

broadly. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir and thank you to all of you and the audience for such an engaging discussion. And I really realize we're short on time. I will wrap

up or make an attempt to wrap such an enriching discussion. And for that there's just three quick points that we would like the audience to take away which I think summarizes this

discussion. One is just the link in between systems. AI is no longer a siloed technical function on its own but it's so interconnected and maintaining that we use different terminologies

interoperability crossf functional whatever we call it but that link is very critical the second which I really glad we got to on this panel is the human element of AI the fact that AI is

an enabler but not something that we see independent of and I think every single panel member stressed on that to really look at how we can ensure it's not an all-encompassing function on its own.

And then the last probably my most favorite is how grounded we were in this discussion. I think it was very refreshing to hear such good questions on how this is relevant for women, small

holder farmers, for vulnerable populations on the ground and the discussions around AI tends to be very I call it invisible cloud above us. that is important but we don't know what that

means on a dayto-day and I think so much of ensuring this discussion is accessible how are we ensuring AI is affordable these are very critical questions that we continue to ask at

such senior management levels and at least for me I found that very refreshing and I walk back with a little bit of hope from this um with that we want to thank you for your time so much

and for hearing us out it's been really nice to be here thank you to our panelists and I'll hand it over to the organizers to formally wrap the event. [applause]

&gt;&gt; Thank Thank you so much. It was a brilliant panel and uh I thank you all of you and also um all all of all of you who came here to attend the panel and now I would like uh the organizers would

like to to um give you some momento. Uh so I would ask the Miy to to come and present moment to direct but the first to dire director Naidu from the independent office of uh evaluation in

Ephat and then uh to uh Maidu the chief data officer of world food program. Um and and then we have Binda Gundai from um

the chief of the ICT for development from IFAD, the International Fund for Agricultural Development. [applause] &gt;&gt; Then we have Dr. Provino from um the director of innovation from the the food

and agriculture organizations of the United Nations. &gt;&gt; Then also we we have Dr. Nantha the chief economic advisor uh to the government of India. [applause]

Last but not the least we have Kovitzan who did amazing job moderating this session. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; I request Anub also to accept the momentum from Matei side.

&gt;&gt; Anub Sharma from EAD. Aloop sat with me day and night to get this together. So, thank you to him and all of our team for doing this. We'd like to take a formal photograph to wrap

up. And thank you again audience, a lot of our partners that we see in the audience. We appreciate your time.
