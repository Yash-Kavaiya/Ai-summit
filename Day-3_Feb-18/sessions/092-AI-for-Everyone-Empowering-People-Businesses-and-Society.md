## 📝 Transcript

Next we have uh Mr. Love Agarwal IAS [applause] and uh brief introduction about Mr. Mahan Aryman Sindia. He is an AI entrepreneur blending a legacy of public

service with a vision to make uh India's tech future as a co-founder of Iara AI and Kuber AI. He's working to make India a global hub for data services, AI model training and AI native enterprise

platforms leveraging India's talent and attracting global Indian expertise back home and uh Lavagar one of the most trusted administrators of our time who led

India's COVID response and now shapes India's global trade strategy as a director general of foreign trade. Next I would like to invite uh Mr. Kishor IPS.

Mr. Kishor is a young police leader with a rare background in AI and data science from IIT Karakpur now applying technology to public safety. Uh next I would like to invite uh Mr.

Dr. Pulkit Swarup uh SVP engineering at at physics walla building education technology for millions of learners across bhat Sanjay

next I would like to invite Mr. Sanjay Vanal, co-founder and CEO of Spine. Uh I think he is uh yeah he's he's coming. Uh we can start the panel discussion.

So I would like to start with uh Mrs. Cindia. So India is seeing a strong momentum in AI backed by government vision and

ecosystem growth. What excites you most about India's AI journey over the next five years? &gt;&gt; Um firstly I'd like to thank you for inviting me uh to be a part of this

esteemed panel. Um I think as a young entrepreneur it's a privilege uh to be able to speak um and be a member of the AI summit. Um but I think this question is a very interesting question. It's a

question that uh I think about a lot and have been thinking about a lot over the last couple of months. Um and something to really think about is that first I want to make you guys aware of the

current AI ecosystem in India today. Um along with uh the government policies and initiatives that have come in. Um let's start very first with the India AI mission. Uh we there's an outlay of

about 10,000 crores uh to be spent to build the AI ecosystem in India. Now what does that mean? That means firstly uh put together a large amount of data centers. So invest hugely in data

centers. Secondly uh build a large GPU infrastructure. So India's the government has already bought around 38,000 GPUs uh today in India to subsidize uh cost to startups. uh

companies like um Survi um companies um uh like Nani AI we've been working with have taken advantage of such infrastructure to develop more localized models on voice on chat uh to

be able to service uh Indian customers but also to be able to service foreign national companies wanting to enter India and the Indian ecosystem. Um thirdly, you have a huge talent pool.

You have approximately 5 million developers a year that get created, 1.5 million engineers that get created. um you had 30% of uh employees slashfounders

not only in India but abroad who are Indians including members of multinational corporations which I don't need to name like Google, Microsoft etc. Additionally um more than that you have

to look at the digital ecosystem today foundationally uh you have almost 75% uh mobile penetration in India. uh you have 100% of that having for either 4G or 5G access uh which is a fundamental to any

access of any AI technology. So looking at as a whole the ecosystem is ready in the next 5 to 6 years you're looking at 25 to 30% kagger in the AI sector. What that means is that you're getting a $30

billion market value within AI in in India today. But all this is very exciting. The ingredients are there, the flavor is there. Uh but unfortunately something

that I am not very happy with within the Indian ecosystem is I'd say us as individuals. I think uh when I talk to a lot of youngsters in India today uh people in

my company uh people abroad working for other companies um what I've realized um is that we often fall prey to short-term gain rather than long-term investment employees people the youth we often

think of okay where will I earn an incremental salary okay ch I'll earn two lakhs more in this company, I'll move to that company. I'll go window shopping. Then I'll say, "Okay, fine. I want five

lakhs more to another company, I'll go to another company." So eventually you create horizontal experience and no vertical experience. You move from one company to the other company to the

third company. Secondly, we become service providers. We don't become owners and builders. So we go to the US a lot of our star [snorts] uh labor force from specifically the

coding and engineering backgrounds move to the US work for companies in the US create products in the US and give those products back to India to consumers here. So that mentality now needs to

change and we need to take advantage of our own ecosystem. We often blame saying government policy but I think Today is the time where I think young

Indians like us need to take advantage of the ecosystem and really build for our country. Um and I think that couple of sorry I'm taking a little bit of time because I feel uh passionate about this

question. &gt;&gt; Um but the point is that this is the time where I feel like young entrepreneurs [snorts] uh young builders like us need to take the hardship

forward not take the shortcut. Right? We always want to say okay jaldi say how will we earn it takes 5 10 15 years to get there and I'll take a make a very good example uh today you look at

eternal as a company right you look at zumato zumato wasn't a multi-billion dollar company overnight it took theinder goyel hard work years of manifestation to get to where the

company is today and then give that value not only to himself but his employees similarly for us um it's taken us 3 years we didn't get investors people didn't want to believe in us we

couldn't create uh people thought we couldn't create the value in India but we didn't stop believing um me and my co-founders decided to take the plunge we said don't worry if if people are not

going to believe in us we believe in us we'll make it happen today we employ almost 3,000 people ourselves and our vision is to make India the center of model training why should companies go

to a US company or a European company to train their models. We have the talent, we have a high intellectual capability, we have a cost advantage. Um we also have a very high skilled labor force. So

all the ingredients are there and I think the next five years um I think it's really up to us as individuals how we take advantage of this ecosystem around us and make it a part of our DNA

to make that change. &gt;&gt; That was an excellent take on uh existing ecosystem. So I would like to invite uh Mr. Sanjay. Sanjay is the co-founder and CEO of Spine uh building

real world AI products that businesses adapt adopt scale and pay for. Welcome. Thank you. So my next uh question is uh for Lagarval sir.

Sir, India is pushing AI strongly through policy and national initiatives. From your perspective, what is the most impactful way the government can ensure AI reaches the last citizen not just big

cities and big companies? You know I'll start from what uh my distinguished panelist talked about. I think from government perspective what is very important is that we have to

look for AI as an inclusive tool. You know the topic for today is again welfare for all. So when we talk about using of AI we should not be thinking of AI as a tool in itself but something

which gets embedded into the digital public infrastructure which government of India or state level it is getting created. I also would like to talk about this

embedding of the technology into the system today because when you see a colleague from police service is using AI in his governance at the field level. I think to that extent we have done that

battle. I think kudos to the uh you know efforts which are being done and from that is a perspective what we need to understand is that you know we have to think of AI as a enabler.

AI is not an end in itself. It is very critical to understand that when government comes up it comes up with tools which affect people at large. Let me give an example primarily in my

present assignment wherein I deal with importers and exporters from this country. [clears throat] In this case, can AI be embedded into the software which we use to provide permissions to

people as a policy not create one tool one pilot somewhere but I engage it in my digital public infrastructure through which services are provided to common man so that it is accessible to

everyone. Can this be put to use in terms of ensuring that if you are going to fill up voluminous forms within the system that can be aided by AI? Can it help me in terms of understanding that

if someone is trying to utilize or gain the system and identify those people those organizations so that at least the genuine exporter or importer does not get harassed but the rights wrong set of

people can be accounted for. So that is where AI can build in. Similarly there are use cases in agriculture. Can I use it to do soil analysis? Can I ensure that based on the soil analysis?

So something which is very cutting edge, something which affects common man is what we need to focus on. And I strongly believe you know India has to start thinking in terms of AI tools for

itself. We are a country of 1.4 plus billion people. We have to start thinking of LLM which are based in India of LLM or these small language models which are based in India. Indian data

and based on that getting embedded into the software which government is making for people at large and ensure that it actually becomes a policy to utilize AI as a tool in terms of going down to

communities. So it has to be primarily focused on common man rural areas than in terms of only certain pilots. We need to come out of that pilot approach. We need to actually understand that

technology already exists. It's a revolution which is happening. We're passing through it and we cannot lose that opportunity. Thank you. &gt;&gt; My next question is uh to Mr. Kishor.

From a policing and citizen safety perspective, where where can AI help the most in India? Crime prevention, faster investigations or public safety

delivery. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you Radhak Khan. I would say all the three. So AI I would describe just know the sa has described it is an enabler. I would call artificial

intelligence is the iron man suit that every Indian policeman requires. So if you actually think about anybody who have traveled abroad can appreciate our existing policemen are all Tony Starks

without the iron man suit working across with all the constraints underresourced under staffed and often overworked. That is where AI is going to empower each and every policeman to give

their best to the citizens. sitting here I could say the kind of vibe coding and the environment that change that we are seeing now just imagine an app dharma app that we have you we're currently

using in uru is entirely coded by our own team without any vendor support so that is that has already helped us to get more than 31 people accused the bad pe bad guys to be convicted for a life

which is a 156% increase compared to the previous year. So the playground is now AI has become very accessible for each and every government department especially for departments

like polus. So there is a big playground where everyone can build products to their problems because going forward GPUs are standardized, LLMs are standardized.

What makes you unique is the flavor that you bring from your domain expertise. The person who understands the problems, the processes, then the to build the product has become

easier. You can simply white code it. But that's where the domain expertise hands are now strengthened and especially AI in policing. Policemen every day

deals with loads of data, lots of CCTV feeds. It's very easy to deploy one lakh CCTV cameras. It's very difficult to analyze and go through each each of them. So that's where AI will come. AI

will actually help us to see more to analyze more. It gives us more reach like how an iron man suit will take Tony Stark to places allow him to take instantaneous

decisions on the spot in which actually policeman operates. Any police leader would operate within the time frame. So they there is no time for deliberation. They don't have complete information. So

in the retrospect we can analyze all the decisions or the acts that were done but most of the leaders do operate in those in those constraints. So AI is exactly going to fill in those roles and sir has

rightly pointed out these pilots needs to be scaled up and Mr. Cindia also has pointed out that these tools needs to be built from within India. I would proudly say the project that we are working in

started 3 years before and which is the first in the world to automate entire policing workflows where an investigation co-pilot was built from end to end from the any citizen can

today walk in to Aluru police station and log their complaint by speaking to a voice bot in their own language and their entire conversation transcript will be available for the future. So

they can so the transparency is there, the empathy is there. So the uh the pilots are ready. Now the job is how to get them scaled up, how to in institutionalize them, how governments

can identify these problems and build institutions around them and how the entrepreneurs can come and commercialize them and export those products to outside. So then uh definitely whenever

these pilots become strong products and used across because crime and criminals they never have jurisdictions they won't see eluru they will come from anywhere and everywhere so that's where uh I

think once we start those institutions around these technologies and build these products into very reliable products the police can deliver much more than they are currently doing for

the Indian link. The next one is for Mr. Pulkit. If AI has to benefit every student in India, what is the one breakthrough it can deliver in education? Better

learning, better guidance or better access? &gt;&gt; Okay, first of all, thank you for uh inviting me to this panel. Um I think I would want to acknowledge there is

certain things that AI has already achieved till now and there are certain things that we see that it will do for us. So the first bit is what it has achieved and what it can do for us. Now

moving to that if you ask me today I would say it would be guidance and with that I'll take a little bit of pause here and I'll ask everyone here panelist or uh you know the the audience is one

question that that every student encounters in the life is what do I do next? I have passed my 10th what do I choose from here? So the real gap is not

information anymore. That is what AI has already achieved. The real gap now is the direction. Does a student need help in solving a maths problem? Yes, he does. He would eventually do that if he

chooses that field. But what AI can then step in and help him is identify does he want to go for J does he want to go for neat does he want to go for a UPSC examination does he want to go for CA or

completely different entirely different thing. So basically if AI can now step in and help you know identify the strengths of the student, their financial limitations, the their effort

patterns, their learning capabilities and based on that they can move to the most important question like I posted earlier uh that that is there in education in anyone's life. What next?

So if you say AI uh can be a universal teacher, it already is right now. You go to the internet, open up chat GPD, open up Gemini, open up uh clot, ask a question, it'll give you a lot of

things. But what now a student needs is a lifelong mentor, a personalized lifelong mentor. And that's I think that's the direction that we're taking at physicsfall as well where we are kind

of breaking down the entire journey of a student by first principles. uh like uh Kusha talked about uh you know having a voice bot we reach out to the student try to identify what are their learning

needs what kind of course are they looking for are they selecting the right batch is it you know uh they're just preparing IIT because their friends are doing it or they're choosing IIAT and J

because it's the right choice for them making them help helping during that journey then once they get in giving them that personalized experience they have doubts in a class. So a teacher is

teaching to the entire class. It cannot be personalized. The traditional way was you raise your hand, stop the class. Now what used to happen is the teacher used to digress not being able to complete

their courses. That's where we again plug in AI today is where the student can start interacting with that AI on the platform and start asking their question while teacher is continuing

with what they are teaching. Uh similarly it goes beyond I think uh Kishorser would have already I would uh you know he would have given a UBSC examination uh written a long essay. So

today what we do is we have this uh AI grader a tool that we've built which evaluates uh the written handwritten assignment on the platform uh and it give feedbacks hey this is what you've

done good here this is where it does not meet the UPSC guidelines this is how you could have formulated it if that kind of a direction guideline the students can get access to I think that's that's

something really groundbreaking that the AI can now uh start doing in many more fields beyond education Thank you. That was that was very good. Okay. Next, I would like to invite Mr.

Deepit. Uh he's the co-founder and CEO of InShots, shaping how millions of Indians consume information in the AI age. &gt;&gt; Um hello. Um thank you everyone and uh

apologies for um holding the panel and I it's good that you guys started without me. Um so I think um the platform that is getting created because of AI right it has a lot of potential and a lot of

risks right on both sides and um so it's a classic example of how a startup looks like high risk high reward um and just that now the riskreward has to be um acted upon and calculated by the entire

entire collective and not just a few uh founders or few uh stakeholders in one corner of one room. In fact, if this is done in that sort of manner, then the risks would outweigh the rewards and

hence it needs to be a more broad-based um uh discussion. And I'm so happy that India is leading the way um in organizing the AI impact summit because a country of a billion people, a

democratic society, a multicultural society is best positioned to do that. So yeah, I'm really grateful key we are doing taking those steps. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Uh also love sir has to leave. Just before leaving I would like to take take his closing comments. Sir as India engages globally on trade and partnerships how do you see AI shaping

India's global position as a consumer of technology or as a leader shaping the rules of the future? You know what AI has done? It has actually democratized knowledge.

It is not something you know the expert knowledge is not in the hands of few but as was mentioned you can go to any of the LLM and uh in that sense you can you know get those knowledge at your level

India with 1.4 4 billion people we are actually sitting on the cusp of that revolution. If we start understanding that we can never be a consumer we can actually be leader

then only that game will change. I would just like to give you two examples of how in my earlier assignment and that is you know around the time when chat GPT was also not in place we were working on

AI just to highlight you know how government is trying to integrate AI into its own processes. You would remember we all had tough time during COVID. It is around that time

when we had a platform called integrated health information platform where we were mounting 33 infection prone diseases across the country line listing based and then we realized that it is

very important to understand media and identify early warning signals. It is at that time we had a tool integrated into our surveillance platform where in 13 Indian languages we were able to call

out the data from across the platforms in India even all the way from Chhattisgarh Jarand etc and we were able to identify those early alerts and based on that we were able to react that is

one part I just want to highlight. Similarly during COVID you should also relate we also had um the challenge that we could not come out and we could not even go to a hospital that is the time

government of India launched a tele medicine platform called ejini. It is around that time I remember I was actually traveling a country and the health minister of that country offered

me and my minister the health minister that he said we have a tele medicine platform we would like to give it free shi to you. I had to politely ask him sir what has been the performance so far

and he mentioned that you know we have done 200,000 calls till now and I had to politely bring to his notice sir e Sanjin we does 500,000 calls per day friends I am happy to highlight to you

that till today 30 cr calls have been done on that platform free of cost to the common man of this country and let me relate to you the first question you asked me how is it that it will actually

help common man. &gt;&gt; Now with this those 30 cr calls the data which we have gathered based on that already an AI tool is in the making based on which you know the

disease profile of this country and probably no one in the globe will have that much knowledge which this tool will have which Indian government will have and how much it can actually take us in

terms of ensuring that we are able to serve the common man. So primarily from that as a perspective a country of 1.4 billion people the talent which India has if we actually do not take our

rightful place in the AI arena it will be our loss. I would also like to highlight to all of you something which I very strongly believe. We captured the or we crossed the knowledge barrier

already through AI. Think of it that this knowledge barrier supported by robotics in future which is what is happening today across the globe in all the labs

and if you start talking about autonomous robots AI supporting those robotics and so then we will basically this knowledge barrier supported by the execution ability. We

are talking about the biggest revolution in technology which globe has seen till today. And it is for us to ensure that India not only focuses on AI, it also should focus on other cutting edge

technology which are there, integrate them together and then we make an impact and what we have to always understand that India is known for its lowc cost research.

It is very important for us and something a statement made by someone I would like to cite it is that why did deepsek not come from India? Why did it come from China? [clears throat] We have

the ability we have the manpower and as been told by Mr. Cindia you know all the big companies across the globe they are having Indians running the show. It is probably the time that those Indians and

the you know spectrum of Indians across the globe we all come together including the talent within country today and we ensure that we drive the agenda. So I think it is very important for India and

we are in the right part to ensure that we take a right place when it comes to usage of technology. I am really sorry friend there was a meeting which I had slightly later it got preponed. Uh

kindly permit me to take your leave and uh I would just like to go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you sir. &gt;&gt; Uh uh I would like to request the panelists to just gather for a group

photo. Uh sir uh just a photo all the panelists. Thank you sir. Thank you. Yeah, we can continue. My next question is to

Mr. Sanjay. Most AI success stories come from large enterprises. What does the path to AI adoption look like for India's 63 million MSMES?

&gt;&gt; Hello. Yeah, thanks for inviting me for the session first of all and uh sorry for being late. uh I left well in time like almost took two and a half hours of buffer to reach here but the traffic was

like so huge. So on the way I was thinking about what could we do to use AI to solve this traffic problem right. So so many opportunities that you can think through and uh like there there

could be starters which should come up and and then solve this as a core problem in India right so I mean and it is not going to go down. So every day you see new people moving in the middle

class and and a lot of cars getting on the road right. So this problem is going to go worse and worse as we see uh in future. So yeah I mean this is [clears throat] one of the aspect like

similar to this there are massive number of problems that India is struggling with right now with scale that many few countries right now are uh uh facing right so I mean one of the problem that

uh we are talking about is the the kind of MSMES depth that India has 63 to 65 million and uh the problem that they are solving right now how can AI facilitate and help them like gain in their

business. Right? So you see like multiple ways to look at this particular problem. So software adoption if you see last few years like lastuh maybe 15 to 20 years and see MSME adopting to the

software ecosystem it is still very under penetrated right so not many of the software companies have been able to penetrate and commercialize softwares that are massively successful among the

uh small businesses in India but the AI has given a room now to really penetrate in this particular sector ment right so what what MSMES are struggling with right now so they are struggling with

their uh their their their invoicing their payment collections their inventory management the the way they will be able to reach out to their customers right and and all all done at

scale doing very very efficiently and at a cost optimized manner so so you see like not many companies are still attempting to solve the MSMES problems in India and uh and and one of

the fundamental reasons is it is hard like when you talk to MSMES these are not only single language speaking people these these these I mean these MSMES are speaking as many as like 50 plus

languages in the country right so popular languages so what options do startups have right so do we solve for the MSMES which do not pay you very high or you do you do focus on the segments

that pay you relatively much higher and also easy to penetrate, right? So I mean my my my entire point is to that uh there are buckets which you can solve efficiently and uh build a very highly

profitable business. Uh like for the example like US if you see we we focus in the US markets and uh solve for the automotive dealers there are close to 70 80,000 dealers there in the US which

all speak English have good paying propensity right now for a solution like us. We solve inventory uh voice AI conversational intelligence and lot of like different problems due because of

which they can increase their business. But the same solutions that we are building are also very much applicable to Indian MSME ecosystem. It is just the adoption of that solution in a very

costefficient manner that we need to do to to make it like really massively big market 65 million MSMES right so just just a ton of gold that we are sitting on right now if you are able to really

crack this particular market so yeah I mean we are fighting hard we took this particular battle to first target the US market and build the solutions in a space in a at a scale that can be rolled

out to the MS SMMES in India and there's a path that we are we are chasing and so so are many other startups and uh I would recommend like going deep into the Indian ecosystem and solving for it. So

great opportunity does it present. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. My next one is for Mr. Cindia again. Uh you lead both startups and

institutions. How do you ensure AI becomes empowering and inclusive rather than something only the privileged can benefit from? &gt;&gt; So I think personally um I think AI is

already pretty inclusive. Um again like I mentioned the foundation of the usage of AI is based on how much internet accessibility you have, what infrastructure you have and today uh

that infrastructure is pretty strong in India. uh if you look at the smartphone phone penetration, if you look at 5G penetration, 4G penetration, but I think in terms of inclusivity, it's not just

access to infrastructure and access to connectivity. It's also how you build AI, right? Uh the fundamental is what data sets are going in to train these models to ensure inclusivity. Now, India

is a very diverse country. uh we have over 28 languages over thousand dialects um how do you it's a very complicated landscape to include that inclusivity in so it's it's a complex problem but also

it's a huge opportunity so for large companies or even startups in India I think to even tap certain regions is of huge economic value it will uh promote inclusivity

um and it will also uh promote revenue generation. That's part one. Part two is is that uh there's a as I as you as you know I'm involved in var various institutions as I'm talking and

conversing with uh a lot of students uh what I'm realizing uh slowly is that u while students are very well aware about what AI is they don't know how to use AI and I think a large part of inclusivity

also means how do you use this tool right so I think it's very important important for institutions to be connected to where the industry is moving, right? If you want to be able to

uh create uh human assets, right, in India for our country, there has to be that synergy between industry and institute. So that way you keep creating courses and educating students um with

the most advanced knowledge bases. And how AI is moving today is every day there's a new model, every day there's a new tool, every day there's a new feature. So if students and the youth of

this country are not well-versed in not only how to use it, but how it's trained, how it works, they can't protect themselves because data privacy is also a huge uh point that we need to

focus on as a country. While we're using all of these international models, we also need to know where all this data is being stored, &gt;&gt; right?

&gt;&gt; And how this data is being used by these international companies, &gt;&gt; correct? So these are all questions that need to be looked at um at a very close level in order to promote inclusivity in

terms of tool usage but also inclusivity in terms of diversity of tools to address various uh regional populations and diversity within India. &gt;&gt; Right. Wonderful.

Again on the similar grounds Mr. Kishor uh my next one is for you. uh as AI becomes widespread, fraud and cyber crime are also evolving. So what should citizens be most careful about in the AI

era? And there is a there is another question to that. What guardrails should always exist to ensure AI strengthens trust not fear. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. The more uh the technology

like you always say that it carries with uh double edge &gt;&gt; right double edge. So when we talk about AI empowering people, business and society, we're also talking lot of

Indians who are very very tech-savvy I would say I don't think there is any country which adopted uh the digital payments like India did. you go to any remote uh agency area where

nothing is available, power might not be available but you could still see the UPI scanners and that also breeds lot of scamsters. So not just AI was democratized now for

the well-meaning people, it is also democratized for the bad fellows. So now the crime is not just on the street from the street scale. The crime has now moved to the software scale and I think

in another 5 years or maybe half the decade it will once the cyber physical the physical hardware also gets into the AI and the combination of robotics imagine the power that criminals are are

also going to wield. So we as a society and especially us as law enforcement we need to prepare for those cha challenges and the only way that we are going to be prepared for the those challenges is by

using them. So we always say that police because he's more motivated he only has to succeed once police has to succeed each and every time. So how are we going

to tackle this very asymmetrical challenge? So that's where I have uh the previous question comes. We are so far using technology more at an individual basis.

We need to scale it up. We need to institutionalize those technologies. And second at the same time we should be very uh like the country that we are in we the moment you put out some uh

application or some uh app we don't question much we just tend to jump in and start using it without the con thinking into the risks and consequences. That's where educating our

public before onboarding them to such technologies is very much required. I think a drastic approach is required the way that we still teach in the schools even in the uh

very small like first standard second standard because they are the people who are actually the primary consumers of the mobiles at home. if you actually look into it. So, but all our awareness

is always targeted on the people who have money. But I would tell an important statistic. All the people who are losing cy money to cyber crime, they are not illiterates. They are there are

judges, there are lawyers, there are police officers who are very well aware about these scams. So, how are the cyber criminals are able to convince and get these money out from them? because they

operate on first principles I would say for crime the greed the lust and the speed of money that they would want to make. So till we solve address these concerns again using technology earlier

to create an awareness video it would have taken a lot of short film actors and it it's a gigantic effort for district police chief but now we could create lot of awareness videos directly

from AI but again cyber criminal is also able to generate those deep fake videos etc. So the industry and regulator you spoke about regulators. So that's where we the

one important industry that could emerge as the tech to recognize what is AI and what is not &gt;&gt; and second we are building all these amazing

systems but how are we going to protect the data poisoning issue? What if the so-called LLM that you are using is deliberately poisoned? Is there explanability for the solution that you

have built or released into the market? How are we how are you going to tackle these prompt injections? &gt;&gt; What are those safeguards? So I think policing role and the realm has moved.

It it is no longer look at the traffic, look at the look at the laws, uh write down, catch some fellow. So now we are moving to a advanced realm where even the money now is which is being

laundered is no more physical cash transactions. The money is moving immediately into crypto getting layered into across different NFTs also. You would be surprised they're not even

using cryptocurrency. They are using NFTs to launder their money. So there needs to be a drastic change how we educate our own law enforcement. There is a lot of

need for the civic society, the entrepreneurial community to come and join with police to protect the public. Wonderful. Thank you. [applause]

And uh I think we are almost about time but yeah I would like to ask Mr. Pulkit. So do you think AI will make education more equal or will it widen the gap between students who have access to

access and those who don't? &gt;&gt; Okay, I'll take an interesting stance here. I'll ask you a question now. &gt;&gt; Has it already not? So uh it is

&gt;&gt; yeah so just taking to that answer see uh if going back reports and data about half a billion people in the country already have access to smartphones by the end of 2026

it is projected that about 1 billion people in the country will have access to smartphones &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; what is the population of the country

1.4 4 billion. So, you know, high quality content uh if it comes to education, high quality uh explanations, doubt solving uh content uh practice questions, anything. It's it's basically

commoditized by AI now. It's it's already there. You know, you go to Gemini, you say I want to take a J need practice examination, &gt;&gt; It starts a timer, it starts giving you

was it available earlier? No, &gt;&gt; it was not. So see the important question is now we are limited by how the country is growing not by how AI is growing. AI is already moving at a pace

and they are moving in hours not in days not in weeks not in months. So we have to catch up as humans now. &gt;&gt; Uh so the the you know the playing ground is already leveled. There is

there's no inequality. Uh so yeah I think that's that's &gt;&gt; thank you and uh my next my next one is for Mr. Deepit. So you

are in the media. So India is moving fast in the digital and uh AI adoption. How do we ensure citizens stay informed with facts not influenced by algorithmdriven narratives?

&gt;&gt; Absolutely and I think um thanks for putting me on the spot. Uh so uh this is the most difficult problem that we are dealing with day in day out. Um in shorts of course people know it's a news

app. It's a short news app. Um and we have another app called public which is a hyperlocal social media app. Across the two products we reach about 120 million monthly active users.

And while design I'll give the answer through an excerpt uh of how we design public uh which is a social media app but making sure that we weeded out uh fake narratives right at the butt. The

only thing that we ensured in the platform was two things. First that the content gets distributed hyperlocally. Second, any all people who want to create content on public and have access

to distribution, they need to verify themselves. They need to be KYC verified. Our country guarantees freedom of speech for people. They our country doesn't guarantee freedom of speech for

bots. So that is a clear differentiation that we need to understand and implement in our social media profiles. If you are unable to trace who is the creator of a content, then you will never be able to

uh weed out fake news or fake narratives uh in the market. Right? As soon as we associate an identity, you won't believe the number of reported uh videos on our platform is less than 01%.

Okay? And those reports are also mostly that a person doesn't agree with the point of view right and the person is ready to if there is a police complaint the person is also ready to visit the

police station claiming that I have put out this narrative I have visited the police station tell me what I need to do if there is a larger law and order issue that is happening they're happy to take

it down also upon the police's uh request right so we the country is functioning country has a functioning system as long as you make sure you put the intent and the spirit of the law and

not just the letter of the law while designing systems. So that's all I uh would like recommend everybody in the ecosystem. Try to understand the spirit of the law and then design systems

according to it. Law cannot move at the pace technology is moving. We as responsible leaders need to make sure that uh enforcement moves at that pace. &gt;&gt; Right. Right.

&gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Yes. Uh I think we are almost about the end. Any any closing comments? Mr. Sanjay? &gt;&gt; I I I think uh we are at the right cusp

of time right now and uh the AI has given us the opportunity to build and think uh think big think big for the globe from India. solve extremely complex problems here and uh

[clears throat] and target the markets which are easy US or or Europe right so once you are able to solve Indian problems the the path is so so easy because because if you're able to solve

here you are able to solve like globally the problems so amazing opportunities we are sitting on right now at this moment thank you [applause] anything uh Mr. India with

your closing comments. &gt;&gt; I think it's a wonderful discussion that we had. I just leave one thing. I think when uh the civilization started, it all started saying gold is gold. Then it

slowly more coal became gold. Then oil became gold. Then came the data is gold. I think today with the technology and the AI democratization problems are going to be gold. The people who

understand problems will create the gold. There is no other country other than India. If you can solve any problem in India, you're solving it for the world. I think if you can solve the

traffic in Bangalore or all our cities, I don't think your solution will be challenged anywhere else in the world. &gt;&gt; Very interesting. Uh I think uh can we can we wrap up?

Okay. Uh thank you everyone for attending this. Thank you very much. [applause] Yeah. So we have some momentos for the esteemed panelists.

[cough] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh Mr. India please Mr. Thank you. Sure. So deep and uh yeah Mr. Pulkit

All right. Uh, thank you everyone. Thanks again. It was very, very good session.
