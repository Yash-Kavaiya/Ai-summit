## 📝 Summary

AI incidents are emerging as early warning signals of systemic, cross-border risk - but the global infrastructure to 
capture and learn from them remains fragmented. This session brings together policymakers, and 
technical experts to explore how interoperable AI incident reporting and monitoring can strengthen prevention, early 
warning, and coordinated response. Participants will discuss institutional designs —from shared taxonomies to secure 
data-sharing—that can turn incident data into actionable governance, standards, and risk-management insights.
