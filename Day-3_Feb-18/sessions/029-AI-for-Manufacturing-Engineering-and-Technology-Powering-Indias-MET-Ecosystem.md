## 📝 Transcript

days of industrial transformation. So we will just wait for a few more seconds or minutes. We are literally counting. I hope our uh speakers had a good round

of discussions in the morning. I hope all of you could exchange cards and exchange notes. I have uh you know I'm I'm very proud that the Namchech team could uh invite all of you here for the

last two weeks. We've been speaking to all of you and I'm glad that all of you could make it here today. So thank you so much. Uh we will just wait for a little bit.

story is being drafted kind of AI that's been used to make this video. But industrial AI which when deployed at scale across factories, production systems and industrial value

chains holds the power to reimagine manufacturing and propel India into an era of unprecedented growth. Our honorable prime minister Shri Narendra Modi also envisions AI

professionals as the core architects of India's future. Professionals who can work seamlessly across cloud platforms, edge devices and high performance computing environments to power [music]

intelligent factories and manufacturing ecosystems. However, as India works towards building this future and competes for a position of global leadership in smart

manufacturing, the biggest challenge it faces is the limited availability of talent. To address this urgency, a national manufacturing engineering and technology

[music] ME platform is being envisaged. This platform brings together industry, academia and government in a shared governance and execution model to place manufacturing at the core of India's

accelerated growth and decarbonization agenda. NAME India's first MET institute [music] is the convenor and catalyst of the MET platform. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for coming in.

&gt;&gt; Good morning sir. Shri Amitesh G will you kindly take the dis as well? Please be seated ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Good morning and a very warm welcome to

all of you once again. It's a privilege for Namtech to convene this strategic dialogue on AI for manufacturing, engineering and technology powering India's Met ecosystem under the

leadership of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. Your presence here today reflects a shared belief that AI is not merely a digital tool but a foundational driver

of India's next phase of industrial transformation. Without much ado, I call upon Dr. Ibrahim Hafizu Rahman to deliver his address on the topic. Thank you so much,

[applause] &gt;&gt; honorable minister, honorable chancellor of MIT, Professor Grimson, uh distinguished leaders of the industry and academia, ladies and

gentlemen, um welcome uh to to uh this uh round table. Uh welcome to this uh uh our focus is on AI for manufacturing engineering and technology. Uh it's a privilege to have all of you here. Uh

today what I'm going to do is I'm going to take you through uh uh the concept white paper that we have initiated. We have initiated it under the ages of of the ministry uh with support from the

ministry but also with active participation of of the industry industry leaders some of you have already started to contribute to it and the academia. The idea is to to uh take

the work that we had initiated uh last year in May uh to to to take forward the the what what the honorable prime minister has emphasized for manufacturing to be contributing in a

major way uh to to the growth of the country of contributing to more than 25% of GDP. So we take that idea forward and and with that NMTECH has been working on this MET concept of manufacturing

engineering technology. We had convened under the ages of the honorable minister last year uh in May uh where we had discussed the kind of uh interventions that are required and and now that work

is being taken forward uh through this where we want to see MET integrate with AI as AI is re reshaping uh not only the industry uh but also the entire ecosystem as we develop it. uh one of

the key elements that's going to happen is that AI is going to going to contribute uh majorly uh to our GDP and and to take the GDP forward and in this process manufacturing is going to be a

central element. What we are proposing here is to look at the challenges uh that we face with the the how AI needs to be rolled out from a manufacturing point of view the complexity there in

but also the issue of inclusivity it's not only taking AI to the big industries and to the corporates but more importantly to the MSMES and and and to the rural ecosystem uh of

microenterprises that we have so that is is important for us. What we have planned to do is is to launch uh uh not only the concept white paper but initiate an executive council council

which is led by by the policy makers but also industry as well as academia to come together to shape the white paper. Uh this event is not a one-off event. It's as I said a continuity of the

effort that was initiated in May. It is going to be continuity in terms of we group together. As I said we already have got excellent inputs from the industry from the academia. Some of the

leaders are already here. We've had interactions with the uh with with the secretary meti with other leaders at matei in order to shape this. Some of the elements are are indicated here. uh

for instance looking at uh data unification, looking at data security elements, looking at elements which focus on on creating test beds uh for the industry where some of the AI

elements can be uh tested together in a cluster approach where where there is coming together of of different players of the academia to come forward on on the innovation and on translational

research pathways of of using AI uh not only for for solutioning at the industry level but using AI for pedagogy as well where we can impart education. So these are some of the things uh that we have

initiated. What we want to do is that with the executive council in the next course of next 3 to 6 months we'll work together with you to give this a shape and then we will present it to the

honorable minister and to to matey uh to to really action it as part of of the uh AI mission that we have. Uh we we we are short of time. I I would request the honorable minister to to unveil the

concept. Uh there is the barcode on which you can use the barcode to to really look at the paper and the concept that is there. But as I said, this is just the beginning. We look forward to

your collaboration, your cooperation and your leadership. Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Dr. Hafi. Will you kindly present it to the honorable minister to release it?

Professor Grimson Amitesh G Sanjay &gt;&gt; today's convening and the launch of the white paper on AI for manufacturing represents an important step in shaping this collective road map. Our objective

is clear to move beyond pilots to scale adoption particularly among MSMES to build an industry ready enabled AI enabled workforce. Thank you so much. May I call upon the honorable minister

to kindly deliver his address and talk to us. Thank you sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much uh team Nam and all the distinguished uh leaders present here. AI is transforming practically

every aspect of a life and manufacturing certainly is going to be transformed in a very big way. In fact, what we call AI today started primarily in the manufacturing and the

industrial sector way back in the early 2000s when the convergence of compute, sensors and communications started happening. Cost of all the three started happening in early 20205

2010. Then came the use of algorithms for maintenance, for manufacturing, for supply chain management, for quality checks and all those algorithms really

made a huge difference in productivity across different sectors whether it is transportation, energy, um, different types of manufacturing, it

made a very big difference. And now with generative AI and with uh models becoming more and more powerful today frontier models are becoming open source and available

to practically everybody just with a gap of lag of five to six months and more and more efficient models are today available at in the edge at very small uh footprint. With that kind of

change which is happening, it's now possible to put a model in a specific machine, train it for that particular machine, get the actual reliability and the productivity gains which are

required from one particular machine. That thing is now actually possible with that as the theme which is unfolding before us. With that as the development which is

happening in front of us, we have a huge potential to come up with new solutions. And my request to the team NAME would be to use this opportunity to develop that next level of talent, next level of

workforce, next level of pipeline for the MSMES where India can emerge as the major manufacturer of precision components,

equipment. Already the gains which you have seen in the last few years are visible. Today we have some of the most important manufacturers which require the

precision components. They are setting up the supply chains in India because of the availability of people who can do precision manufacturing at scale.

um applied materials, lamb research, some of the space and aerospace and uh defense manufacturers they are all setting up the supply chains here in India. So this is the right opportunity.

Congratulations to team Nam and big thanks to MIT for being with us in this journey. Um as I've said in the past uh if I take rebirth I would like to be educated at MIT.

Thank you so much. Thank you so much for being a part of this journey. Thank you. &gt;&gt; We are deeply honored by the leadership and vision of the honorable minister and by the participation of the

distinguished guests here. May I now call upon Dr. Eric Grimson of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. Eric has been a great friend and supporter of what NAME does. Thank you

so much. Will you kindly address the gathering? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you. And and Minister, as I've said before, we would welcome you as a

student at MIT. What when you're tired of doing what you're doing now, you can come and take a drink from the fire hose. Thank you for joining us today. I want

to just say a few remarks. You've heard some of these already. Um but India's journey towards Vixet Barack 2047 will be shaped decisively by the strength, competitiveness and sustainability of

its manufacturing sector. And to support that transition as you've heard a national manufacturing engineering and technology or ME platform was conceived in order to position India's MET sector

as a driver of economic growth, employment creation, technological self-reliance and sustainable development. Um with the support from the ministry uh

the MET platform was launched in May of 2025 by its founding members NAME and MIT through the Met round table that was chaired u by the honorable minister at that time and it's conceived as a

co-owned co-led national mechanism aligned with the objectives of Vixit Barat which I'm sure I'm mispronouncing but bear with me. AI is emerging, as you know, as a core

technology shaping the future of global manufacturing. Manufacturing is expected to be among the largest contributors to the projected US$15 trillion increase in

global output by 2040. Manufacturing strength in the future though is going to depend on systems that are agile, economically efficient, scalable, and repeatable. And the

minister has already highlighted some of those so nicely. Systems need to adapt rapidly to changes in design or process. They need to detect and react to equipment degradation before it brings a

line down. They need to quickly adapt to supply chain demands as production demands change. They need to reduce impact on the environment. And AI methods can greatly help with all of

those pieces. But many of the MSMES lack the ability to easily integrate AI into their systems. Their workforces are not experienced in AI. It's hard to find

talent to apply AI to manufacturing. Their supply chains are not designed to adapt quickly to new opportunities and needs. Acquiring sufficient data to train the systems can be challenging,

especially when those data sets are an advantage to a particular company. and their systems are often slow to reconfigure for new products or changes in design.

The next phase of India's AI journey will be defined by its ability to move from capability to application. Embedding AI across industry, enterprises and MSSE, investing in

skills at scale and ensuring that innovation remains inclusive. There'll be many pieces of this but key elements will be things like workforce upskilling whether that's online courses

or curricular development with partners coupling online instruction with hands-on experiences or case studies specific to the needs of Indian industries

data governance standards to allow for easy sharing when appropriate of data sets. Creation of shared test beds to ensure that what is developed is going to apply across industries.

Tools to track factory equipment performance, early detection of maintenance needs before a disaster happens. Embedding AI into design processes as the minister already

highlighted. Tracking supply chain needs as processes uh scale or adapt. And this requires my view and I think many others sustained collaboration across academia, industry and government to build systems

that can translate research and technology into real world applications. To meet this need, the MIT or the Met platform rather in partnership with Mighty has instituted AI for Metat as a

focused national initiative and as you heard the creation of an AI for Metat expert council will help guide this transition moving forward. It'll look at task talent and workforce

transformation, applied AI and industrial innovation, and scalable and inclusive AI adoption. AI has the potential to dramatically change what happens to industry.

It also has the potential to do things that we don't really want to see happen. And part of what I hope that this council will do and this collaboration will do is set standards for the use of

AI in ways that are productive for the country, for the industry, for academia while building in the safeguards to ensure that they are not used in ways that damage or undercut that kind of

capability. At MIT, we look forward to partnering with India, with industry, with academia, with the government to help propel this AI in transformation to

change the way manufacturing is done. I hope not just here in India, but we borrow a little bit to bring back to the United States as well. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Dr. Grimson. Uh we have a set

of leaders from academia and industry here in the room. You all of us we have always gone to you for any help for any clarification when we needed our curriculum to be vetted when we wanted

help on how do we structure and design our labs and our equipment. So thank you all of you for being here. I will hand over the das to Dr. Krishnan Balas Subramanyam Institute professor of IIT

Madras one of our advisory council leaders who will chair the next session of our round table. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you Nandani and uh &gt;&gt; no no no please uh we hope that you can

listen from the industry back. So [clears throat] &gt;&gt; okay sure. So um today what we're going to do is we have lot many many eminent uh academicians and many many eminent

industrialists who are here and what we're going to do is to hear from them and request them to make one or two what I call impact statements so that uh the minister can take back from you know

from that. So we have four themes in which we're going to request. The first theme is called AI infrastructure and secure connectivity. It's a big it's a very big topic and I request Vinod Karmi

from uh Cisco to get started. Thank you sir. Yeah. Um good morning everybody. What the esteemed professor did not tell us was he wanted to say this line ever since

Chhattday India came about and Shah Ruk Khan made that sar minute speech. The speech here was sar second atomari. So this is my sar second uh on my AI journey. Um thank you uh we could listen

to the vision that has been set forward and we could listen to I I was so happy to hear when you mentioned edge AI that that is something that I work with couple of my colleagues are sitting over

here as you further for the industry. The way we see it, I think within about five square kilometers of here, all of us are spending time, energy and um some people billions of dollars and the whole

world, a few trillions of dollars to make this industry what it is at the moment. Three challenges which we need to overcome together and we are playing a role in trying to shift all of them.

The first is infrastructure compute. We've taken a fantastic moonshot in India to try and do it. It is reaching across to the people. It will transform the world for sure. Actually power we're

still on the journey. The renewable power trajectory is helping us and I'm sure some of the people uh over here are helping shape that as we move forward. The third and that is data and the

security gap. Actually still an area we are all talking about it. All of us have enough WhatsApp forwards on that. So I'm not going to leaguer on this. But these are three areas where at least we are

working very closely uh with our friends in the industry and with customers. All of us are customers at the end of it when we try and do it. The second one I think the most important one and I've

heard um the minister talk about it in various forums the trust deficit right what will make us use the systems how can we secure AI and how do we have security for AI and security in AI right

that's another angle that we are keenly working with and none of this is possible with all of us in this room and around here trying to shape it up the last one is the data gap we've taken

almost all the data pumped it into most of our engines and trying juggle it out. But that is not going to make sense till we create those wonderfully little models which are economical and

available specifically in case of what we're talking over here through all the MSMES that our country will operate on as we move forward. With that I just want to end the fact that we talk about

often one thing I'm pretty sure while we have these challenges and we will stumble and learn and accelerate in all of them. One area that we should be doing very well is definitely skilling

and and Nantech goes a long way in shaping that up. We believe so that is a reason that we are partnering to help shape this up under the ages of the ministry. Thank you everybody.

&gt;&gt; Thank you and uh yeah probably we'll bring the mic to you. Yeah, next is the from the software side Pravin Anchora please and do limit it to 70 seconds. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. [snorts] Uh and thank

you Vinod. I'll without much ado I'll just pick it up from where we know left on security and trust uh and since the time I've been in this industry for last 30 years we talked about connecting

sensors to shop floor shop floor to boardroom connectivity all across I think that's come of age but everything which is connected is vulnerable it's like human emotions if you're connected

you're vulnerable uh and it needs to get secure but security shouldn't slow us down like a which has got all error backs gives us the confidence to move forward. If you're able to infuse the

right security in our systems, that is something that helps us to move forward. Whether it is on premise, whether it is on cloud, whether it is on the edge, it could be moving asset like a connected

car, everything needs to be secure by design. And we speak about zero trust security, which means you don't trust anything. You first secure it and then verify it. uh it's like a human entry

into a company. You have a access card in the patch. You always have to authenticate, verify, encrypt across all elements of the ecosystem. Uh and that's very very critical. Uh the good news

however is that the today's systems are completely defined to take keep this in order. You have models which can work on the cloud but the application can be on premise like a visual inspection system

is in the plant but the model is running on the cloud uh and it's end to end secure the same security applies across the value chain so and these companies like us are working with authorities

like the device authority with standards like IEC and NST to make sure this is universally interoperable and to that extent takes it forward and there's a living case One of our largest customers

at Nent for example has connected 1100 11,000 devices across 500 different sites in a secure way. So the only way micro SMS can go forward with this is have software as a service have AI

infused and I think uh as I said earlier if you're able to design it in the right way it will help us to move faster and not slow down. &gt;&gt; Thank you. [clears throat] Thank you.

Thank you so much. Um &gt;&gt; yeah so we move to the next uh theme which is um &gt;&gt; we'll just do this one first. &gt;&gt; Can you move to the third theme?

&gt;&gt; Okay we'll go to the third theme uh and that theme is called intelligent automation and competitiveness and request uh Bobby Mitra uh from Tata Electronics.

Hi, [clears throat] good morning and honorable minister. Very uh encouraged by everything you have done for the country. At Tata Electronics, our focus is AI first manufacturing in

semiconductor fab OSAT as well as electronics manufacturing. Now what I mean by AI first manufacturing is there are three layers of intelligence and each of these are pretty intelligent

compared to what the factories that we always think. At the lowermost at the lowermost layer it is visibility. If you visualize a factory just everything being visible, every equipment there are

thousands of equipment. Minister talked about all the equipment, every equipment has thousands of sensors. He also talked about it so eloquently every signal of every equipment, every material being

visible. That's a very huge deal. So that is what we call visibility intelligence of AI through visibility, observability. We do not want to stop there. want to go

one level after you see what is going on at the factory through AI you want to get insights right from what is happening how it is why is it happening to what's the reason why it is happening

that's the insight and that is the root cause analysis there's so much of data there's so much of machine sensors but why is the e low why is the throughput low that is the intelligence of the next

level not just the what is happening but why is it happening That's the next level of intelligence. So that is going from visibility to insights. We are not stopping there. We are going

to the holy grail of intelligence and that [clears throat] is foresight. What will happen? What will happen? So that's where prediction that's where synthetic AI is very important. I mean you are

looking at defects. You cannot conceive of all possible bad bad material. You have to synthesize AI. So that is synthetic AI. AI opens up this whole plethora of opportunities

from visibility which is observability to insights to foresights. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. And uh Mr. Shivas Nayenar from Intel please.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. First of all minister thank you very much. Matey and Namchech hearty congratulations to you guys for a fabulous journey that you guys have taken on. Um at Intel we've been we know

a little bit about manufacturing because we are in that space of advanced packaging and advanced technology and uh what I can say is just like my colleague here Bobby Mitra said um the amount of

sensors the amount of data and the amount of different pressure uh temperature and different physical conditions that the equipments get exposed to create a lot of variations in

the process and obviously silicon is at a very high premium today. So your whole idea is to kind of u make sure that your losses on silicon and the yield is almost optimal and your losses are not

that much seen. So we've been doing this a lot. To name one example uh we have come up with this concept called a cobot. Uh you know about a robo or a robot which basically helps you most of

the defect is handled by a robot today or inspection is done by a robot. a collaborative robot which has learned over time which had ton of data and the data is premium here because we've been

doing processing for a long time. So the collaborative robot is what we call a cobalt and cobot's very active today and without a cobalt today at Intel fabs we won't get to the yield numbers that

we're seeing today. So it's very very important to kind of continue to do that in in general to me uh uh you know intelligence of artificial intelligence and manufacturing are sort of uh if I

could use the phrase digital twins you know they one one can't exist without the other and they've learned to coexist very well it is not uh it is not if I need AI or not it is a must happen if

you want to get into manufacturing AI is a must happen and I'm sure India will do and leaprog the rest of the world very soon and hearty congratulations again &gt;&gt; thank you thank you so much uh we know

over to Mr. Chandra Mori Shuran. &gt;&gt; I just I'm so sorry Mr. Moly. I think the honorable minister you're okay. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Good morning. As a fellow Warton alum, I hope that in the next life as well we get to go to Watton together. Um so I'm a little bit of an outsider. Uh I come from PayPal a

fintech and so I want to bring a different lens to it. Um if you think about PayPal, we process uh north of 25 billion transactions every year. Every decision is an AI decision and I feel

like it has a uh very impactful relevance to the conversation that we are having. You know both the minister and Dr. Eric spoke about uh you know degradation in the production pipeline.

So a great example is that if I look at a transaction I have to think about both a false positive and a false negative. It's not I cannot allow a bad transaction to go through at the same

time. If I prevent a good transaction then I'm impacting a customer. Same thing on the production line as well. And that's why AI in the manufacturing is so important and there is so much of

learning you know that we can all share from each of the industries right and so if you think about MSMES they contribute like 30% of the GDP. Now they don't have access to AI that large organizations

have but this is where Genai comes in. If you think about classical AI which has existed probably since 1960s the thought process is that I use prediction to figure out the bad and the good right

so if you're thinking about a line I can say hey this is a defect that's happening through cameras and all of this stuff and then I can removed from the line now think about it from an MSME

perspective what we need to do is that classical AI helps you find the good and the bad where Genai comes in is that it says hey you know what there is a bad that is going to happen. Now, I'm going

to look at all of the documents that I have, the maintenance history, all of the manuals, the vendor manuals, the spare parts, the catalog, and the warehouse, and then say, "Hey, to the

shop flow person, I basically on their phone in their own vernacular, I can basically bring it to them and say, "Hey, this is going to happen. This is the sequence that you need to follow to

fix it." That is the power of Genai. That is the world we live in. And as collectively, this is what we need to do to solve for MSMES. This is what we need to get in their hand, right? We don't

need them to be data scientists. We basically solve it for them. That is the power of the world that we live in. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. I look forward to the our first academic

partition, Professor Rahul Panerjee. Please. &gt;&gt; Very good morning. Uh this is the time for the new generation of living labs. Living lab as a concept was originally

conceived by one of my teachers uh professor Sandy Pentland and two of his associates in '90s and over the years its definition has changed. Now, European network of living labs

considers a far more wide uh definition of involving open co-working spaces involving multiple stakeholders not necessarily in a controlled environment like the ones initially professor

Pentland and his team conceived. However, this is the time when we can look somewhere between the two. Consider thousands of or sometimes even millions of sensors connected in different

industrial environments generating huge amount of data per unit time and this impacting everything right from something on the shop floor to certain things which would probably go into the

production management defect identification uh prediction for the next supply chain kind of requirement to be taken care of and so on so forth.

So if we need to do all of this, we have this industrial IoT already in place in many places. We also have a digital replica of industrial environment leading to what we call digital twins.

We have mediated reality AR, VR, MR all of them together depending upon the need we have all that we need is bringing people working in different sub aspect or sub areas together to solve a set of

problems which independently alone in their respective work setting they will not be able to do. So this is the age of new generation of living labs. Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we yeah so we go back to theme number two which is going to be on green manufacturing and energy optimization and I request Renu from Hitachi.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, good afternoon and honorable minister and everybody and it's a really a great pleasure to be here and a great job under your ministry is being done. Thank you very much sir. From Hitachi

Energy I give a different lens. We come from the manufacturing our products is bridge between the generation and the consumption. So how is AI and energy is inter interlin and these days even

interwo in that. So somebody said in a very layman language. So data center is nothing but a factory. The input is more energy output is AI. You need a more energy to give a more AI and vice versa

in that. But how do we optimize the energy? You also need the same AI agents to optimize it. And we have deployed you know two of the thing. If I give a two examples, one is that the engineering we

have the engineering center in Chennai 4,000 people they do engineering for the global projects in that the AI agents will optimize the engineering and reduce the throughput time more than 30 40% in

that and same is the case we use in our factories physical AI you know we we build a large scale you know transformers you know hundreds and hundreds of tons of transformers we need

a large scale things you know understanding the behavior of that once we come for the test bed in that I think the the work Namchech is being doing under under the the MET for program is

extremely important for scaling up the manufacturing industries in that you need a more of these equipments in India and creating a energy you know resilient and energy security standpoint and then

the NATE kind of you know uh initiatives is really required at a scale and the speed that is required for this transition. We're very happy to be part of this. Thank you very much.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much Venu. Uh we now have the first uh participant from the public sector Mr. Samir Sharma from NTPC. &gt;&gt; Good morning respected minister. I

represent NTPC which is the largest power company of India with a stalled capacity of over 85 gawatt and we have a very ambitious plan to scale up to 149 gawatt in 2032 mainly through

renewables. So sir we are moving towards green energy and also expanding through nuclear. So on one hand we have a old fleet of our coal fired stations which are by and

large operating in automatic mode but at this point of time we need to optimize it and bring the automation and to the next level for which AI is necessary. So for example the heat rate of these old

stations need to be improved so that they are more efficient and contribute to the present grid going towards digital twin there for a cooling tower for example which consume lot of energy

so there for the fans which are running we optimize the power which they're consuming so we save on it so making it more efficient similarly we have a huge fuel one lakh cr we spend a large large

amount is there. So even 1% saving brings a large contribution to India's growth. Finally in the renewables itself sir for example our uh solar power stations already we are using drones

with air based solutions. So what we are doing sir because it is a you know over a large area it is there. So we identify the problems in advance and take corrective actions so that their

efficiency remains. So in all these areas new and the old ones we are uh going for this air technology because we believe only through this technology we can progress and go towards more

efficient and greener power for India. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much sir and thank you for keeping our lights on all the time. And next is my friend Dip Soni from Rockol Automation.

&gt;&gt; Sure. Thank you so much honorable minister very inspiring comments and namac once again great congrats on uh the wonderful work which has happened. So uh it's very inspiring to see focus

not only on on manufacturing but also on green manufacturing and also energy optimization. I want to emphasize a couple of points. First of all AI can only make impact if it has access to

good quality data. We know that AI runs in data. But in the context of manufacturing, manufacturing, you may not know, is amongst the top three generators of data. However, this data

is very different. It's very hard to access, right? To be able to access it, to be able to process it in a secure manner is very very critical, right? If you're able to do it, uh it's it's

generally estimated just for reference that only about 1 to 1.5% of manufacturing data is accessible today. So top three creators of data a very little amount which is today accessible

but if you are able to access even a little bit more the amount of insights you'll be able to to gather are going to be great and these are going to be giving you gamechanging insights which

will allow you to optimize your operations and uh you know really demonstrate uh the the power of predictive quality. if there's going to be a little bit of a a model drift which

can cause the quality uh to go out of spec you can actually take actions before the event occurs right and that has far-reaching implications last point which I want to make over here is I

think India has a great advantage we have a challenge a lot of our manufacturing sits in MSME right uh which until now was more seen as a handicap but I think at the same time

MSMES what they do not have is a lot technology debt, right? And what India has demonstrated time after time is our ability to leaprog as we did with mobile telephony and so forth. And I'm hoping

through the use of AI, we're able to do this leafrogging again and and really become a top three manufacturing powerhouse. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. So we go to the

fourth theme, cyber security, trust and governance request from uh Palawalto Networks. Honorable minister, thank you very much for this opportunity.

Um, on the topic of cyber security when it comes to manufacturing and IT, I want to start with an ex two examples. Unfortunately, out of India, PaloAlto Networks gets called proactively to

provide security, but we also get called reactively when things go bad. So um unfortunately one a couple of unpatched servers brought down an entire manufacturing organization. A fish tank

thermometer brought down an entire enterprise. That's how dangerous OT can be if not designed properly. So I'll talk about three elements when you design the network and the enterprise

for secure OT. First is micro segmentation. Ensure that one farmer who's putting his or her sensor online does when breached does not reach the entire network. Micro segment it second

understand behavior analytics of every sensor that you're putting on the network. AI is used today to do that. You just have to ensure it gets implemented from the get-go. Third, use

tools like AI for vulnerability assessment and proactive policy recommendation. This is being done today by cyber security by the good cyber security companies. Implement that. So

my request to Namtech, we look forward to partnering with you. We look forward to ensuring that these principles are brought into schools when the individuals that go into the industry

this becomes a habit not something they remember later when things have gone bad. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. Request Dr. Vive Mohindra from Dell.

&gt;&gt; Yeah honorable minister Mikey and Namchech. Congratulations on this launch. Um Dell has the broadest portfolio in the industry covering server, storage, networking and PCs. uh

and we have the number one number one enterprise AI infrastructure provider in the world and we have sold over 3,200 AI factories to a lot of the enterprises. So my comments are informed by that

global perspective. U there are three recommendations on that front. The first one reflecting uh all the comments that have already been made around the security vulnerabilities

and recognizing that it's better to bring AI to data than data to AI would be creating affordable edge solutions uh which are affordable and and can be adopted rather quickly and readily by

the MSMES. Second would be to have a validated AI factory solutions for the edge. And this validation necessarily needs to be zero trust in bases and to make sure that

some of the some of the vulnerabilities that we just heard about do not emerge at the edge. And the third recognizing that humans still remain the biggest vulnerability and no matter how you

implement it, governance plays a big role which then directly ties into skilling necessary for MSMES. so they are aware of all the vulnerabilities they may be creating along the way. We

have Dell uh are hugely uh excited about the opportunity and we look forward to partnering with you on that. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. Uh request Ritwick from uh

&gt;&gt; good morning. Yeah, &gt;&gt; thank you and leaders from industry and academia. N thank you for this opportunity and talking from a consumer's perspective.

say speaker before me talked about the amount of data that we generate in the manufacturing setup and I think six seven years back uh we thought that we need to move to industry 4.0 zero bring

the data to the four so that we get value out of that but you are doomed if you don't do if you do also you have challenges on hand so for that uh sir uh since you are here I thought uh this a

big opportunity for putting across a lot of expectations first thing is uh we need to have openness in the access of the OT systems because that is where we see value integrating the OT with the IT

systems so that the supply chain is more robust post it's more agile and we get uh better margins for every dollar we spend today. That's a major challenge. The second thing is uh we have a large

set of uh LLMs which are there. We have different solution providers who are bringing it to us. A major part of this remains unverified. So there is no way we can guarantee that

the sets of intelligence that we're using on our data is being rightfully used. So there has to be standards there have to be governance around it which should ensure that the models that we

use are sanitized and they are safe to use. And the third things I also go to a lot of uh academies for picking of students for hiring. It's a big gap between expert students

and good workers. So and when I was speaking to Miss Daz Gupta two three days back before this I'm happy to note that NECH is doing that to help us bridge that because otherwise it's a big

gas station cycle that we have to take them through to make them operational for us. So kudos to you and the ministry for doing all this. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Um as usual the

academicians always have the last words. So professor Rajiv Wahhuja from IIT Roper please. So thank you and first of all I would like to thank minister and he also comes from IIT. So so I can

speak more than like the other people. So coming from a young generation IIT IIT roer and as you last speaker clearly mentioned about the gap actually this

gap is from industry side not from academia side because I'm living for last 32 years in Sweden where industry come to academia not academia go to industry. So we have to work together

actually and then we can make this AI force which can be employable in your companies and uh which you always say that they are not readily employable. So I'm representing here IITs and other

engineering colleges and we are setting up the IoT labs to other private and small engineering colleges. So they can be trained in terms of IoT or any application which is related to I AI or

in cyber physical system. So AI is going to play a key important role and IITs are doing that one and we are already having a MOU with NMECH and we are working together with NEC actually and

we want to bring that culture that industry should come to academia and we should use the academic man force in in industry. This will be a two-way process. This cannot be done

just always saying that there's a gap, there's a gap, there's a gap. So we have to work together and AI is going to be play important and the IITs are going to play key and important role to make

India as a AI in the world leader country. AI is going to play important role and IITs are going to play important role also. With that I stop. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. Today

morning when I got up I said I have a mission impossible [laughter] and thank you for to all the speakers to make it possible. &gt;&gt; Appreciate [clears throat] excellence.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Absolutely. Uh thank you. We are right on the dot. I just want to leave uh uh one last message from my side. Every technology needs what I call three A. One is

awareness. Second is [snorts] availability. Third most importantly affordability. I think that's exactly what we need to try to achieve here. With that, I thank the minister, I thank

Namtech and thank Sanjay and Eric here for being here. And uh thank you so much. And I will let Nandini take over from here. &gt;&gt; Thank you professor Krishnan. Uh you are

always our savior in many ways. So thank you so much. I will request Sri Amitesha to kindly deliver the vote of thanks. Thank you Amitesh G for being our supporter right from day one on this

event. Thank you &gt;&gt; on behalf of ministry and NAMTH. I I extend sincere thanks to all of you for coming here. We have heard about uh what kind of skilling we are going to

provide through NAMTH and that is very very important and uh we we need your cooperation, your insight, your suggestions in developing the curriculum. Thank you. Thank you for all

and last but not the least to honorable minister who has uh spared his time for this event. So we are all thankful to him. Thank you sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you. [applause]

&gt;&gt; Thank you everybody. As we conclude we reflect on this dialogue and we will send out our notes to everybody. May I request all the speakers to come on the front and we can take a quick photograph

with everybody. May I request all the speakers? Uh Pravin. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can I can I have a quick picture with the speakers please? Please and the

honorable minister. Can we do that very quickly? My NAMtech team, if you can usher everybody. Is is the picture being taken properly?
