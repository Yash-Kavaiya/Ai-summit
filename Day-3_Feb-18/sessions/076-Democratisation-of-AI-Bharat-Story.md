## 📝 Transcript

training. She is recognized for her straightforward nons noonsense approach and her ability to bridge the gap between complex technology and policy uh policy and citizencentric governance.

Thank you ma'am for being here. We have uh Ship Pani is not there yet at he'll be joining us in some moment. We also have Anuman G the director of the Madhya Pradesh

government. Just a sec. So um he is a dynamic ang officer is on the path of becoming a future IT secretary of Madhya Pradesh. Probably a

meaty if he sticks to the service. He's our additional MD of MPS EDC from Madhya Pradesh. Thank you. Thank you Anushma G for being here. I would like to invite our CEO for Karnataka digital economy

mission uh who is leading uh the state's digital economy for the government of Karnataka. Mr. Sanjay Kumar Gupta the ISS. So I request you to be please moderating this session. Thank you to

you all. I hand over to you sir. &gt;&gt; Very good afternoon to all of you. It's a great pleasure to be here in the Bhat Mandapam especially looking at an India AI impact summit. uh impact can be seen

uh by government in a big way and what else we can aspire to see the b the executives the leaders of the government from the great states of India Karnataka, Telangana, Odisa, Madhya

Pradesh representing the entire India here today. Uh why we need this and why we need this uh topic to be discussed about it. U we have seen um in our journey of digital transformation

Mr. Fani welcome welcome Mr. Pani. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So people do talk about of Bangalore and Hyderabad but Delhi is not Delhi is also there in a similar way.

Too bad. [laughter] &gt;&gt; It's [laughter] absolutely we require the GPS now to govern to come to the meeting room number 18 as well. Coming back to the

topic the democratization of AI and Bhat story. why this topic is required for all of us to have a discussion and why we need the great leaders of the government share their perspective on

this topic today. Uh thankfully the government of India's initiatives the state government's transformation job has lead to amazing results in a digital stack that has been created across the

country from examples from farmers to financers they have been now leveraging the tech platforms in a big way. Yes, we have seen early results. Examples of UPI, the Aadhars, the etc have seen 14

billion transitions happening on UPI, right? Actually if you see that we are looking at around 1,400 million citizens in roughly around 700 districts with 22 languages going to be the largest

community of humankind in the world that we're going to serve in that journey when you have got these digital stacks across with us the question comes is this new wave of AI the intelligence

wave which is coming up in front of us and yes AI has been blessed embraced by technology innovators and also by the enterprises a lot. We see every time a new enterprise looking out something of

coming out from here. But then if I go back to my statement farmers to finances where this AI is actually leading to and is there a story and is there a question marks is there are some answers is there

some partnership platform that needs to come together. I have many questions in my head. I thought I will invite the great leaders of the government today here put up some questions to them

understand that what is that they are looking at from their perspective and what they're doing in the respective states and is there any good connects that the audience and all of us can come

together I know audience comprises of the entrepreneurs audience also comprises of some think tank players here audience is also the student community and some of the people around

who is influencing the technology in a big way So can we connect these examples with all of you and maybe cut up one or two questions of the last from the audience if time permits

state is the symbol of democracy expansion the democratization implementation both ways from the population perspective India is nothing else but the state governments and if

this has to be seen at that level my my first question goes to uh you know let's say anumanji I pick up the first question with you right now from Madhya Pradesh

in your 77 spanning districts that we have I see that agriculture deploys 70% of the workforce what does the AI democratization means for this last mile and maybe linking

with the direct benefit transfers as well right your crop intelligence linking it with your social protection do you see there is something which is happening around or could be done some

examples examples of those demogrigization of AI in the real field of 70% of your population in 77 districts. Mr. Aluman, &gt;&gt; uh thank you sir in uh in 55 districts

of Madhya Pradesh. You you rightly said that agriculture is the backbone of Madhya Pradesh and we are not looking uh in in case of agriculture we are not looking just in uh issuing advisories to

the farmers. We are going beyond that. We are like going into the life cycle of agriculture. So for example, suppose I had provided the advisory to a farmer and then he sows something. The first

thing he expects from the government is that whatever he sws is digitized or is recorded in the government document somewhere. uh in local parliaments we call it gdawari and earlier the patwari

used to go to the field and they used to measure how much area is there and what type of crop has been sewn there and based on this uh the procurement happens the what is the what is the total

expected food that can be produced from that field and if any disaster stuck then what compensation then they they can get and again the APM fussel be my yosna is also based on this gdawi record

so what we have done this is our fourth cycle we are now directly using satellite images to automatically tell us using machine learning algorithms that what type of crop crop has been

sewn with an accuracy of 95%. So now the the both the omission and commission both has been removed. Now the farmer does not have to go to the Pwari and based on this data we are also

calculating the crop volume which is there and we are automatically telling that this might be the their expected uh total produce that uh we can expect and this has helped so much uh in in in in

case of disasters and then again in procurement we used to hear that whatever the quantity is sometimes some states they they give extra bonuses above what the MSP is there And then

there are some we keep on hearing news that there are leakages then crops are coming from some other state and then they getting sailed uh in in some other state. So we have reduced all of these

using uh our machine learning models and we are in the fourth season. So it has quietly quite matured. &gt;&gt; Okay. And it has lead to some yields also. Have you seen some yields by your

crop intelligence system that you developed? Actually sir because again since climate is changing and then again we have seen that I will give you an example of soya bean farmers. So we have

seen that because of changing climate uh the rainfall pattern has changed and again there might be some time when we might advise uh the farmers to sew the soya bean some days before or some days

after to avoid this season because even if it rains and if the if if the soya bean fruits if the fl if it is in flowering states and even if it is even if it rains before that then it is okay

the the loss would not be that much. So we have seen an increase of around 25% in last 3 years using these technologies. &gt;&gt; And do you see that the trust on the AI

systems of these farmers is increasing or is still becoming a question mark that whether we should believe or not believe? &gt;&gt; Uh actually sir I believe that trust in

AI based dem governance is a subset of trust in governance as a whole. So I I have found I will just share an example. So uh two years ago there was a hail stom in one of the villages. I was

posted there as an SDM. So and crops of some 17 villages were affected. What usually used to happen is that once crop damage is happening then pwaris go there and then they mark the field and

based on the extent of damage between 0 to 25% they don't give any uh relief between 20 to 25 to 50 they give some other relief and based it is like this. So for the first time what we did we use

satellite images of pre-event and postevent to find out based on NDVI that what is the extent of crop damage. We also since we were experiment experimenting for the first time we also

took the uh manual way where our team went and then they surveyed the field and you won't believe that with the manual way the total amount of compensation was coming to some 18.5 K

and with this satellite based exact pinpoint data we got it at something around 4.5 K and there was not a single complaint for from any farmer but that my name has

been deleted. related or some corruption has happened or so so we solved both commission and omission and there was not a single complaint. &gt;&gt; Very nice. Very nice.

&gt;&gt; And and this shows the trust this shows the trust of the people in technology in AI and in governance as well. &gt;&gt; Got it. Got it. And in fact the results also shows that roughly 25% yield is

what is expected when you leverage AI and ML solutions especially in the agriculture you know in a field. Coming to Vishal Gi to you, you know, yes the AI systems are there but the language

and the skills which becomes the most like a biggest barriers for any AI system to be implemented. Um I know you enough number of years you doing entrepreneurship in bureaucracy. You

experiment new things right and you and you design those systems and then you finally deliver those systems as well. How is Odisa thinking about these citizen centric platforms skilling and

language inclusion to ensure AI is accessible and trusted by all. Uh thanks Anjie. Very good morning to everyone. Good afternoon in fact. Uh so you know when you talk of uh

citizencentric platforms language localization just two things I want to say before I begin. One is far too often we've seen you know as as government officers or bureaucrats that uh we get

muddled up in technology jargon etc. If you keep it simple you let's say we're discussing democratization of air resources. What does it mean? It means accessibility to everyone irrespective

of you know region soio economic background etc. affordability at reasonable cost and of course you know all foundational models should be available. So that is something which I

think all of us need to keep in mind. The second is for a state like Odisa the context becomes very important because uh the point that you me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me

me me me me me me me me mentioned. So Odia for example is a low resource language. &gt;&gt; There is very there are very little quantum of data sets Odia data assets

that are available currently and that is one major you know target that we have challenge. So we have uh kind of taken up uh you know conversion of uh a large number of texts historical and others uh

and 1,600 texts have been converted. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So far they've all been contributed to OIO of the India mission &gt;&gt; and this exercise is continuing. We are

also uh going to be launching a program called Odia Bhashadan very soon. The idea behind it is that we've identified 13 uh uh sectors wherein we will request people from all walks of life including

some experts. So there are sectors like tourism, history, celebrities of visa etc major landmarks &gt;&gt; uh major events and all. So we will launch this program wherein people will

be asked to contribute professors people from the villages. So geography is immaterial but we want to create a massive uh you know data corpus which would then be you know converted into

machine readable form and made available. So the idea is that more and more language data sets need to be available because AI is what &gt;&gt; correct

&gt;&gt; I mean the more you train on data the better it becomes &gt;&gt; correct. &gt;&gt; So uh that is one on these citizencentric platforms there are a

couple of very interesting works that we've taken up. So with servan serv we've been having this project on rice fallow management. So rice fallow management is primarily people who take

up one crop. So patty is the most common crop in Odisa and once people cultivate patty mostly in kharif season thereafter rai they don't do anything. &gt;&gt; So the idea is how do you encourage

multiple cropping patterns. So there is a database there is a directory of farmers. We reach out to them through this model. In fact, uh uh this time there were 50 lakh calls that were made

&gt;&gt; uh to farmers through the servant platform asking them if they had received imports, you know, giving them information about their soil conditions because everything has been mapped

hyperlocally. So we have plotwise information. So soil conditions, weather conditions and we send them advisories about what we need to do. And the third was I think you mentioned uh skil the

second example is uh so Odisa has sever the language has several dialects uh so there is a coastal dialect there's a western dialect there's a southern dialect and within these dialects also

there are variations so we've taken up this exercise of you know voice based uh data sets to be created district-wise &gt;&gt; so for example sthali the way it has spoken in Mayurbanch could be different

from the way it has spoken Correct. &gt;&gt; So capturing you know those dialect specific details. &gt;&gt; So that is on the language side. On the skilling side again we are looking at

you know multiple verticles. One is what do we do within the government. &gt;&gt; So with Vadwani Foundation we have uh tied up for capacity building of the government servants across. So starting

from a clerical level to sector level officers everybody's getting uh trained. We have a program called AI for all which is available free of cost &gt;&gt; to general public. It's about a 4 and a

half hour program. It can be completed. And then we are having uh scaling programs at the institution levels across all our universities. Just uh two weeks back we launched a program across

12,000 of our schools &gt;&gt; uh for high school students uh you know to give them a basic understanding of what AI is. So across the gamut we're talking of scaling of citizencentric

platforms and language is very very important for us. &gt;&gt; Lovely. And I I hear that you're also collaborating with the universities especially to bring them on some of

these language data sets coming up together. So correct. &gt;&gt; Is there any specific project you're driving upon? &gt;&gt; So uh with Odisa University of

Agriculture and Technology for example agriculture is one of the major priority areas. So we have health education agriculture. Disaster management is very important for Odisa because we are prone

to cyclones. Earlier the frequency used to be once in three years now it's kind of increased to twice a year. So we get two cyclones. The intensity is also higher.

&gt;&gt; So uh and governance. So these five areas we're working on health, education, agriculture, disaster management and productivity within the &gt;&gt; Very nice. So under that this OUAT Orisa

University of agriculture and technology we having a program wherein uh very uh you know technical terminologies agriculture related information that is being uh uh created

&gt;&gt; right now I think these models of getting partnership with institutions is a great one because they can bring out the various forms medical colleges the other institutions of different data

sets from the different kinds. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And that will help you to cover the multiple sectors of the and bring the data course &gt;&gt; right

&gt;&gt; upper lovely um &gt;&gt; I think the language the trust comes into place the skills comes into place examples of yield and agriculture comes into place I'll go to the you know you

know Dr. from Mangala Gi. We have almost like 1 million engineers graduates annually passing out uh obviously and Canada is the leading state in terms of the tech uh graduates

but still there is a persuad which is putting together a rapid uh technological advancements as a challenge as well right yes we have an advantage in Karnataka but we also see a

challenge in terms of these skills which is coming up is there any very specific initiatives that the government of Karnataka is driving which caters to fill this gap because all these demands

are created the solutions are coming up but who will deliver that right is there any specific initiatives that uh you would like to share. Uh thanks uh Mr. Sanjiv I mean we are one team so

[laughter] wherever I wish you can always pitch in. Um uh I mean of course everybody knows about Karnataka and more so Bangalore city and the kind of uh technologically advanced skill force

that we have and the people that we have. We can boast of about two and a half million of technically qualified graduates and professionals in our state. So, so you know uh the last three

decades IT IT related services we have excelled and we are also coming to the uh the AI revolution that we are all forcing or we are already in the midst of it. So uh the skilling upskilling and

skilling the unskilled is a priority for the government uh because we also have to catch up with the AI race that is going on uh and also the benefits not merely a race but because of the

benefits that it brings to the society at large. So coming to the specific targeted programs uh I would like to mention here one particular initiative called Nepuna. uh nipponite is a

initiative where you know this is very tailor made for the industry's needs and highly skilled programs are also being uh you know so that the people skilled under it are ready for employment that

is the idea in fact the initiative focuses so much on industry partners and the service or the uh what do you call aggregators who in turn can provide them the necessary job and placements etc

then link for that that is how it is structured the good thing about this is one is this is a common platform where we bring together the industry requirement and the people who are ready

to be skilled and the people who can skill them and then the people who can help them to uh uh get the placements and employment opportunities. That is one thing. U secondly the government

itself is taking a substantial cost uh proportion of this cost. So whatever be the cost of training a person we pitch in 40% of that. So that is the the advantage is highly skilled, highly uh

you know good institutions we can provide the skill and good industries which have identified the required skills all are coming together and that this is the advantage. Beyond this also

there are multiple uh areas through which we are skilling our people. This is one specifically targeted program but like I would like to mention about the centers of excellences that we have

excellence that we have and professor from our IIT alumni center is right here including his organization we have more than 20 centers of excellence centers of excellence you know have a mixed I mean

each each of them has a a set mandate and a set um uh you know outcome required deliverables set out but then broadly all of them cover encouraging research because they themselves act as

u institutions or they are housed in institutions which already have a research uh and development mandate or already have that advantage. Secondly, they support innovation. They reach out

to startups which uh you know um you know which uh which are filtered and identified and then the ones which are more likely to be productive, more likely to be successful are boarded onto

this uh plat uh the centers of excellence. Further there's always the industry collaboration because all the industry partners in our state know the benefit or the advantage or the

leveraging which which can come through these centers of excellence. Lot of problem statements are rooted through these centers of excellence and our innovators or researchers work further

on these innovations. Apart from all this we also have a skilling line which is also been mandated through the centers of excellence high level skilling. For example, we did the VLSI

uh skilling which was had a great response. Likewise, AI related skilling and specific structured tailormade skilling also has been planned. So, this is another way of doing it. Thirdly, you

all know we have lot of academic institutions in our state. Many of them date back to pre-independence era and they're all extremely good, extremely academic oriented and today they are all

lining up with the industry requirements. lot of the institutions that I can name a few like the RV university or the Manipal University Alliance Alliance yesterday uh le just

last week they signed up for a quantum computer a partnership with one of our quantum computer um um company which has manufactured the first quantum computer so they have that kind of alliances

though what I'm trying to say is through that also lot of skilling is happening through the regular academic institutions but with a structured curriculum and we have courses AI etc

are proper degree courses offered in many of our educational institutions. Beyond this government institutions the public institutions also are following the line you know kind of precedent set

by the private education institutions. Lot of government universities are also aligning with uh these kind of partnerships and secondly our curriculum is also being tweaked. A lot of the

universities are going back to their uh board of governors whatever the body is academic body which decides on the curriculum re uh re you know reooking and reviewing the curriculum and then

you know structuring it to make it AI and industry ready that is what we are focusing on. So this kind of a multi-pronged approach if I've left out something we can add. [laughter] No I I

think I will just add with you saying that uh the cities like Mangalore and Masur and Hubli Belgad Belgavy are emerging uh tech cities now and they are actually having the talents of this kind

for example Hubli itself has 6,000 AI resources serving to the global clients in city like Hubli right and you have the center of excellence on AI in IIT triple IT Dharvad in IT Dharvad so

Dharvad is flowing Mangalore has a cyber security center of excellence on BFSI So these are the areas where &gt;&gt; we have specific centers of excellence like IIT alumni center is specifically

working on EIR likewise we have a new center of excellence coming up which looks at AI in biotechnology &gt;&gt; so our premier organization called camp will be anchoring that that is shortly

on the anvil similarly we have a separate s center of excellence looking at applications in AI applied AI technical solutions we call it for cats in short Yeah.

&gt;&gt; So that is also started operating. So these are like organizations which look at focused this very much focused on AI related and of course other than this I mentioned the other centers of

excellence more than 20 in number which are looking at various other sectors and other deep technologies also. &gt;&gt; True very true. Thank you. Thank you man. One question which just comes to

you is that you are 20 I'm thinking we 20,000 startups plus in the state of Canada uh 1 1700 plus AI and AI related startups raising roughly uh $2.8 8 billion in last one and a half years.

Amazing results. DBI is a parallel track coming in place. Uh industry is also there. I see that DBI and industries are like a rail track like a railway track has been laid down. How do you see uh

that Karnataka is going to leverage these great two tracks of industry that we possess big one 400 out of Fortune 500 companies are operating from the state of Karnataka you have a DPI laid

down from here your all Aadhars are technology bases coming out from Bangalore only how do you see these two tracks built up leveraging each other for the openness interoperability

uh you know coming out the data privacy excitement how do you see this can be you know leveraged. &gt;&gt; No true uh I mean very valid point because now there's so much being built

based on these kind of data which is available like we I mean India can boast about our Aadhaar the identity platform that we have and the UPI which uh has revolutionized so many uh solutions

based on fintech. So I mean of course many of them Karnataka has directly indirectly a lot of uh role that it has played. Um apart from all that I mean this is of course there are regulatory

mechanisms there are mechanism for accessing the data on which solutions are being built but Karnataka itself can boast of its own lot data sets which we have for example like uh though our

department IT department doesn't directly handle it but we have a sister department called the egovernance department which is a which is a repository of all this data like many of

the other states have also described how farmer related interventions have been done solutions have been found out likewise we have immense number of uh products which are being rolled out or

already rolled out in our state which has generated enormous data. For example, the fruits data, the farmer uh produce related data is one data set we have. Likewise, health uh you know

status of the citizens is something that we have. Likewise, the public distribution uh distribution data we that we have. Uh likewise, forest and land resource, smart city data we have,

smart city datas we have, data sets that we have. A lot of this is uh is the base on which you know a lot of um you know solutions and the AI uh related models and solutions can be built. So we have

created a EI cell within the egovernance department which also has a initiative or we can call it as a portal called e sahi. Yeah &gt;&gt; e sahamati. So, e sahi is a place or a

portal where any uh founder or innovator or a company who needs to access such data can directly reach out through this portal through the department and where they work it out based on the you know

data security and data privacy and then utility and all that will be and then the kind of data access is being provided. So this will be the foundation data set with which many other solutions

are being built. Another great thing I should say which is being developed by our own uh in triple it Bangalore is one of the identity platform which we have built. This is called MOSIP that is the

it's a open-source uh identity platform called modular open-source identity platform. This has been a platform which is readily usable by many nations and states on which they can build their

identity platform like Aadhaar what our country has. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So many African countries and many countries in um Asia Pacific region &gt;&gt; 35 countries is using now.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. They already adopted it. So that was a product which came out of our center of uh it's called as um u center for digital public infrastructure which is well within triple IT Bangalore. So

it was in in developed in that center and these are the few examples which I can quote &gt;&gt; exactly and I want to take this question thank you ma'am I want to take this

question to all of the all of you see the public uh you know digital infrastructure is being put together in a big way by India stack and bhat stack right how do you see that this can be

leveraged with the innovations by the startup which is coming up in Udisa in Madhya Pradesh in Telagana where you have a already a rail track innovation track is coming in place government

doing something very differently to put two together enabled much more so that the now the growth of the AI can be leveraged in all sectors of the economy any examples any thoughts

funny will go with you first thank thank you Sanjiv G uh first off I just uh want to thank uh everyone for being here and uh thanks for this opportunity um I also want to quickly uh correct my last name

is Nagarjuna so it's got misspelled so I just want for everyone to everybody's uh benefit but um I do want to take a step back here on and uh on the topic of democratization of AI bar story right so

I I believe fundamentally that uh when the cost of access becomes zero then uh it really lays the foundation for democratization in India for any technology right but for that to happen

I think what Telangana is doing is taking a step back to put together a holistic approach approach uh to invest today to build a leadership position in AI and uh starting with structure,

policy, ecosystem and capability. I'll talk about the structure in a bit and um policy-wise Telangana is one of the first states uh to put out a comprehensive AI policy in 2024 u not

only about what to do but also about taking a very responsible AI approach uh and an inclusive approach uh to deliver the benefits of AI uh to all segments of the society. So we have all seen in

governance that uh it begins with policy u right and then the second part is an ecosystem approach in AI. I don't think any country or any state for that matter uh can take a siloed or an isolated

approach and uh become a leader um in this race of AI. I think it requires a holistic ecosystem approach which is what Telangana is taking starting with skilling um and uh startup u

acceleration just like Karnataka obviously has been setting an example there uh but Telangana is really investing aggressively on on the startup acceleration front and how do you infuse

that startup acceleration with the necessary financing and we have announced a thousand cr startup fund of funds obviously would be catalyzed with the private uh investments on top of it.

Uh and then bring in uh the industry and academia through a co-inovation and co- research uh programs. Right? All of these are the critical pillars supported by obviously um high performance compute

and cloud infrastructure that is needed and uh Telangan has partnered with AWS and we have announced uh roughly about a 60 uh $7 billion um investment that AWS would be making in

setting up cloud and data data centers in Telangana over the course of the next decade. Right? All of this uh is really your ecosystem uh uh value proposition that are needed. All right. And then the

last part is the capability which is where I started off saying it's the zerocost access just like we have the uh the DPI uh which is like you started off saying like putting on the rails on

which uh the states would have to build the last mile applications. That's exactly I think what is needed here uh on the AI front to enable states and individuals and startups to put together

the last mile applications that deliver the value right but I come back to the s uh the the spec framework I talked about structure policy ecosystem and capability uh but the structure is very

important I think that's where um having been uh across the world and having consulted with different governments. I see that throwing this an AI based uh innovation ecosystem under a

governmental department isn't going to move the needle for the country or for the states. It ought to be an autonomous unified entity with the agility of a commercial startup but the backing of a

government and that can bring in the best practices from across the world and can build out tentacles across different states and outside of the country to bring in the best practices to build

innovation that can move the needle for the country and Telangana has taken the first step there with the launch of ICOM at Davos which puts that exact structure together as well as brings in the rest

of the ecosystem into the fold with global collaborations to drive the so-called democratization of AI for the bot. &gt;&gt; Got it. Got it. I think you said very

well the you know the cost of the access has to be become zero and the cost of access can only become zero if the data center and the compute power cost goes drastically down and what else we need

we need a sovereign AI right and hence becomes related to this question goes to Vishali to you is you know if you pick up these direct benefit transfers and you look at zero linkages welfare

program no linkages absolutely transferred on on on levels AI printing durations s before the families get their dry their foods and and the food grains in the kitchens. Fraud deduction

savings how many crows it's is examples coming up from all over the you know segments vulnerable populations identified early through responsible data. So the question is that do you see

these are the real examples from the state that transforming the lives of the people while zero leakage is uh British has been predicted by the machines to you the logistic and supply chains and

been ensuring to reach out to the food grains to the uh you know families around possibly looking at the disease patterns and etc. Are there real examples where the Orisa and mother and

same question to you Anuanj are you seeing real examples of this kind zero linkage welfare by AI Sanjiv it's a very valid question and I totally agree with what you said I mean

you know technology can be used in various ways and of course AI can enable the zero leakage thing that you're talking of DBT has you know done that to a major to a major extent and last year

we launched uh in fact honorable prime minister launched in Odisa this scheme called subadra wherein a sum of 50,000 is to be transferred to various women so we have about 1 cr 14 lakh beneficiaries

so far I all seen that at the press of a button the money goes into the you know account of the beneficiary what and I remember uh about 15 years back when I was municipal commissioner

of bherneshwar you know we had this major issue of host pension holders and host Russian card holders. So we took up an exercise. It wasn't based on AI but we used technology you know data mapping

and of course some rudimentary elements of what we have in Aadhaar now. So we worked with a large number of software developers to see matching of names, father's names, date of birth etc.

And in a city like Bhineseshwar with a population of about 1.5 million you know back then we were able to weed out something like two lakh coast card holders and beneficiaries. Now you know

that's a massive achievement for the simple reason that that money there's always a waiting list of beneficiaries wanting to you know get into Russian card being Russian card holders or

getting pensions. So it goes to people who right actually deserve these benefits. So the issue of getting right entitlements, benefits etc becomes uh very important and moving forward I

think so AI will be able to take it forward in a much much you know stronger and a more &gt;&gt; you know structured way. &gt;&gt; Vishi we did one small experiment one of

my starters from Karnataka reached out to me and said look we can do your uh survey in 1 hour which you normally take one year. &gt;&gt; I said how you will do that?

&gt;&gt; Yeah &gt;&gt; he said no no you give me a data I I'll show you this part. Now what a survey you can do. I said how you will do just give me the phone numbers and we'll do

that. He's here somewhere sitting in the uh in the audience right raise your hand and and meet them. What he does is the AI engine actually gives a call for them. Very mature AI engine have a

conversation on surveys with every individual in the local language and get the data inside it and give me the results. Thursday launch it Friday morning on my table full analysis done

out of which I find out 50% of the numbers were not valid. So I'm not reaching out to the right department and saying we need to do something corrective measures here. So I think the

AI can actually provide a much faster and efficient governance model. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Right. Which you just showed example of the Russian cars as well.

&gt;&gt; So can you just add a point to what Vishal G said actually it's a very uh astute point and &gt;&gt; but a short point because I want to listen to it. the the the result uh of

uh uh technology implementation I think now uh with AI what he has done could become a continuous example rather than episodic right and that's the beauty of AI is you can scale exactly what Vishal

G has done now on a continuous basis across different programs &gt;&gt; correct correct absolutely &gt;&gt; sir in Madhya Pradesh AI in DBT is not an add-on we don't see it as an add-on

but we see it as an evol evolution of what our DPI currently is. So in Madhya Pradesh we have a we have something called samagra ids of each members. We have it we have this program since 2012.

So we have given a unique ID to each individual and then how it is different from Aadhar is that we have also mapped their families. So in a village we know how many families are there with their

family ids. How many individuals are there who are linked to that villages who is the head and all the schemes close to 400 schemes that the Madhya Pradesh government gives to them is is

with this Samagra ID only and now we are thinking like like you said of of the DPI we don't want startups to reinvent the wheel we have this data and we are ready to share this of course by

anonymizing it and again uh coming on to this DPI front we have another we have two excellent data set sets one is sada in which all the land all the property records all the property transactions

that are happening are now in in Madhya Pradesh they are not now now fully faceless and fully digital so from right from your home you don't have to go to any register right from your home using

Aadhaar based DBT you can directly authenticate yourself and uh do everything now what we are planning is to give whole of this data because again it is a very huge data there are kes of

distal documents that we have distalized 100% which are OCR readable and we are ready to give it to startups and other private sector. So this this was our second offering and

our third offering again in this line was land revenue. So again land revenue is a major component which in in Madhya Pradesh we are we'll be going to dlize close to all the records by end of this

year right from 1900s to current. So you can trace on a single parel of parcel of land you can trace what all transaction has happened what all orders from the or SDMs or collectors have happened and

right up to present place. So and again this is very useful because when you see the all the litigations that are happening in India are more more than 60 70% of the litigations are land based

only and it is one of the core challenges in which you have seen startups like magic breaks or something else which are coming which are predicting what would be the uh property

price of certain area or or they can again in parliament of investment they think okay we'll buy this land and they can predict how much the price can go. So like you were saying in DPI we have

multiple sets of such kind of datas which we are very open to share with the industry by anonymizing it and I would urge all the audience there was a very famous uh ad by MP tourism that someone

was asking what is in the Madhya Pradesh and then he said that come in the Madhya Pradesh and then you can see so I think in se in IT sector I can tell you all that please come to Madhya Pradesh and

then you can see in front in at least in front of DPI We are willing to share many things if the uh partners if they are willing. &gt;&gt; Common I think the common thing which is

coming out very clearly is that uh you democratization of inter of AI uh the BA story is depends upon obviously the examples the languages the skill the data sets cost of uh you know

computation power and some live examples. Now we have only six minutes left and I have two questions to ask one individually and a very short answers uh to all of you please and the one is

general question to all of you which is oneline statements. So first question to you madam is one startup that you think coming out from Karnataka on AI you would like to take a name today.

&gt;&gt; More than one actually difficult [laughter] difficult to take one but then since we are specifically talking about how um startups or ideas which have actually

you know worked on the DPIs and how they have been you know effectively done in governments etc. I would like to mention corover.ai EI I think Ankush is there. He's participating today in the in our

pavilion. He's there. Um uh I think uh they have done well with IRCTC and our um uh NC that's the payments corporation of India Indian navy and they've interacted I mean they've worked with

them product solutions for them generating AI basically and they've come out with assistant or a chatbot which helps you know facilitate of services overcoming the language barriers and

they're all powered by he's that is powered by bar GPT so that is one good example. I think server MII think sir also just mentioned uh server MII and of course like it it is one example which

shows how um you know the DPI and the model which have been uh linked can can deliver citizens better like you all know ADAR the voice assistant which comes on it has been developed by them

and uh um so it overcomes the barriers like literacy and all it's a conver it's also in multiple languages so it's an indic generative AI also And um it is helping people overcome

their grievances etc. through this system it has been done &gt;&gt; lovely and there are many examples that you would like to take up there [laughter] I think we'll give others an

opportunity &gt;&gt; of course Vishal G you know you know one Orisa language AI use case which is breaking barriers faster that we can see &gt;&gt; so I spoke to you about uh the serum use

case for rise value management I think that's &gt;&gt; that's the one &gt;&gt; that's that's going to be a landmark implementation and we've already seen

very very good results of that So primarily you know identifying encouraging farmers to produce more. &gt;&gt; We'll send you some more startup from Bangalore now to serve you on the visa.

&gt;&gt; And to your question Sajjie I think you know naming one &gt;&gt; startup is difficult because each is doing outstanding work in different sectors. So for example in our case you

know there's healthcare there is a startup called remedial. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They are doing outstanding job for detecting you know diabetic retinopathy.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. And similarly for agriculture, similarly for education. So for education we are working on this tool for Odia reading fluency. &gt;&gt; Okay,

&gt;&gt; I mentioned about the change in dialect across various districts and regions. &gt;&gt; So for grade 1 to 8 we are creating voice data sets &gt;&gt; of uh students, teachers etc across uh

different districts. So that's another startup that's doing very well. &gt;&gt; Lovely. And I think you have another health startup which is growing very big in the map of India is your cure cure.

your way doing wonderful work. &gt;&gt; They are true. &gt;&gt; Okay. U Mr. Fani one um uh data governance policy that you will suggest from Telangana that other states can

look at it. &gt;&gt; I give you a chance to say that look copy me. [laughter] We've launched uh something called TGDEX uh Telangana data exchange with uh about

1100 plus data sets and growing with every passing day and this is the first of its kind uh digital public infrastructure on the AI infrastructure data side that we have launched and it's

not only a data exchange it's actually a complete sandbox with pre-built uh a IML models already built into it and providing access it's almost like I talked about zeroost access it's for the

startups to get in and battle test their solutions and then go out and put them into production. &gt;&gt; Good. Very nice. Uh Anuman one bold experiment in service delivery using AI.

&gt;&gt; Sir, I will Madhya Pradesh is excellent in GIS based deliveries. So I will just tell you one example. So recently we were tasked with a with a wonderful work that we have to provide milk to each

Anganaris and then we have to provide an optimum route from the block headquarter that how each anganadi can be served how many students are there and how we can provide milk to each of these angadis.

So we have from past five six years we have developed our own JS-based engine routing engine using again ML based system that we keep on refining and then using this in I think in 1 hour we were

able to map all the close to 80,000 angaradis of Madhya Pradesh in just 1 hour and with [laughter] the optimum route and then what should be the transport method so I think that was one

of &gt;&gt; that's an example for it okay we'll love to listen more from you on that one statement from I said I want to make sure is that MSME is not forget when we

look at our own states uh because they are the largest backbone of the economy from GDP and also from the employment opportunities right I have just done some mathematics on this part roughly $

1.5 trillion is MSME which is being contributed as a GDP 30 kores is the employment which has been provided by them and 10% is the CAGR which is going forward as a growth rate for MSME my

humble request to all of you is the statistics says is that a technological intervention in MSME can lead to 15 to 18% of the growth rate of CGR leading to $4.5 trillion of

contribution to the economy by 2032 333 technology and enabled by AI can transform this part in a huge way especially to microenterprises right please look into this data point

please look into this and advocate as much as you can we are doing experiment called as JAI What we're doing journey experiment is the education institutions the local

industry coming together and finding out a problem then there's a mentorship of AI available to solve the answer of that part and run it then and there so the live projects of the candidate students

the right live example solution given to the industry at a very local level with the network of the AI that we can create and that's called JAI program that we have started with leverage that as much

as you can and also Look good. Now the last question to all of you is &gt;&gt; 10 uh 10 15 seconds. We'll wind up. Thank you madam for this notice. U one bold statement from every state about

your mission of AI in your state. Madam we'll go to you Mangala G. &gt;&gt; Human capital is our biggest asset and what why not we harness it. So skilling is something skilling upskilling and

then providing AI solutions which will make uh you know benefit the society at large is what our our mission is that's what we are embarking on. &gt;&gt; Okay Vishi over to you.

&gt;&gt; It's a macrolevel statement. So we have Odrisa is moving from a mind-driven economy to a mind &gt;&gt; m &gt;&gt; oh

&gt;&gt; because we account for 44% of India's mineral production 25% of India's steel and 55% of India's aluminium is produced in Odisa &gt;&gt; okay

&gt;&gt; so from a minddriven economy to a mind-driven economy &gt;&gt; very nice quickly wind up &gt;&gt; we uh we want to be the world's AI proving ground where the world comes to

actually test and drive their AI solutions Okay, &gt;&gt; for us it is precision in in delivery and dignity in service access. &gt;&gt; Lovely. Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; Audience left for us finanist with a group photo very quickly. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Give a hand applause for the leaders here today. Please sequence.

Next, let's I mean, &gt;&gt; would you like
