## 📝 Transcript

All right, thank you so much. Over to you Priyanka. &gt;&gt; Good morning everybody. Uh am I audible? &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you for joining in. I'm really pleased to moderate this session

today which is called from volume to value role of AI in redefining India's pharma leadership for Wixit Bhara 2047. Uh let me first introduce our panelists. We have a very esteemed set of panelists

here to discuss the topic. We have Dr. Shahul Patel. He is the managing director of Zidus life sciences um and also the president of Indian pharmaceutical alliance. He has driven

Zidus life sciences forward in terms of innovation in small molecules, biologics, vaccines across most of the global markets. He also brings a perspective of the overall Indian pharma

industry, a sectorwide view on where the industry is headed. We also have Vinslow Tucker. He's the president and general manager for Lilian India. He brings a global innovators lens on how AI is

reshaping different parts of the value chain of pharma and also driving a lot of access and expansion in India. We also have Dr. Amit Shed. He's the founding director of IRO and we will

have him talk about it in a moment. India AI research organization. It's a new research organization which has just been founded and I will invite him to talk about the vision. He is also a

professor at University of South Carolina where he founded the universitywide AI institute. He brings a long-term foundational view focused not just on the applications of AI but on

the kind of knowledge-driven and neurosyolic approaches needed for complex domains like biology and medicine. And then we have Mr. Sudaran Jen. He's a secretary general of Indian

pharmaceutical alliance. He is the representing the voice of the Indian pharma industry on topics of research on topics of industry priorities, quality, innovation and global positioning.

[applause] So let me set this up uh by talking about the brief context and then I'll um you know hand ask a few question of the panelists. Indian pharmaceutical

industry uh as we all know is globally recognized for its scale and reliability. India supplies about 20% of the global generic medicines in about 60% of the vaccines reaching more than

190 countries. This scale advantage has popularly uh made India the title of being called the pharmacy of the world. The stated ambition for Vixid Bharat 2047 is to however build a USD 500

billion pharmaceutical industry several fold more than it is today and that cannot happen by volume expansion alone. Over 2/3 of the global pharmaceutical value pool uh sits in innovative

medicines, new chemical entities as well as new biological entities. A structural shift from volume to value is therefore imperative. This pivot is also supported by the government and policy. The recent

union budget emphasized biofarma shaky with increased allocations and policy thrust for biologics, innovationled R&amp;D, advanced manufacturing and deep tech integration.

Artificial intelligence sits at the core of this transition not as a standalone solution but as an enabling layer across discovery, development, manufacturing and patient engagement.

This panel is therefore very timely because we are sitting at the intersection of industry ambition to move from volume to value, public policy, thrust, global innovation and

frontier research. It also reflects a collaboration between IPA and IRO where I has identified pharma as its flagship sector for building sovereign India own AI capabilities. The central question

for us that we will talk about today therefore is not whether AI will transform pharma but how quickly and deliberately Indian farmer can use AI to shift from world's largest supplier by

volume to its most valuable innovation hub. While we discuss this, we'll keep in mind the three sutras of the summit. People, planet, and progress. Ensuring that innovation improves patient lives,

scales responsibly, and create shared value for economic progress. With that, let me ask the first question for Dr. Shett. Dr. Shett, you've called IRO the ISRO of AI. uh if you could explain to

us what IRO's mission is maybe in just simple three statements but also talk about why pharma why why is pharma your focus and what are some very practical and realistic outcomes that you can

expect over the next couple of years from this collaboration &gt;&gt; thank you very much Brianka um so Indian AI research organization as you can see um with ISRO you replace space by AI um

uh in a way we are taking the value of ISRO the u you know frugal innovation but uh such of such great importance um uh and that's what we want to do here with AI powering the solutions uh with

AI um there have been two three main drivers for IRO first is that um India lacks high-end AI talent so I yesterday in the panel I asked to the audience

Suppose I had all the money that DeepS founder has. Um can I get the 200 to 250 very high-end talent um that DeepS had? Uh and uh out of uh nearly 100 people, three people raised hand and two of them

were students. Um so uh you know anybody who has you know general uh you know understanding of where we are I think uh they spoke. uh we have a lot of skill uh we have a lot of skill in AI that can

help uh Indian IT service company uh to get the job done. So first is that IRO is creating worldclass talent but in India uh uh IRO facult Iro senior people the people who founded IRO uh here I

have Dr. Nyogi from University of Texas Austin Dr. Wasan Hana from Penn State um Dr. Sini Parthasati from Ohio State and several others here. Um and Romesh Jan we have trained 190 PhD students who are

world class and um uh we think that what we are able to do in the US we will be able to do here and rather shortly. So first is create a world-class talent. Secondly, uh we wanted to not just

create talent but go what prime minister says go from prototypes to product and so we want to create original IP and uh provide an ecosystem to get it to the market very soon and though that for

that we are doing two things we are working with the startups and um I have a colleague here Juhi Bnagar she's a investor but uh gotten very large number of investors ready preede, angel seed

and growth stage that are available to us. So our startups can don't start for money and we can uh the co-in co-development will be done with IRO. So that way their cost will be much lower

and uh the likelihood of success will be much higher right we have platforms we have many other technological expertise that could be shared um and um then we have to we also want to do corporates uh

where we can achieve short-term economic impact uh when we are looking at um and IOR is supposed to be uh PPP so Ajay Chri who is the uh board uh you know who is our chairman of the board he sent me

a um uh uh uh a a picture that listed pharma at the top in terms of investment in R&amp;D per uh capita meaning or per per the uh you know uh earning right and pharma was at my top by far and that's

why um we uh one reason to focus on pharma is that they at least seem to compared to other choices they seem to understand the value of R&amp;D a lot and since uh we are original AIdriven IP

generation engine for us to see the application there is very valuable and then when I we connected with IPA uh this whole concept emerged and that we found lot of opportunity and I'll

discuss concrete opportunities uh now should I discuss now or later? Oh &gt;&gt; sure if you can share two or three concrete opportunities. So uh we have um uh experts who have prior expertise in

working with uh US farmer and having the results and I also had a project funded by uh VRO that ultimately was sold to NRS noatis and uh you know at much higher you know uh value than the

investment they made into us. So we develop probably the world's largest knowledge graph in pharma. We have that and we'll be refreshing that uh as uh the last iteration was about 2 years

ago. Uh you might be aware that recently a drug was is in the market where much of the development was enabled by the use of pharma for the research and I I'll give you more specific you know

details of what that drug is and such. But just having this knowledge graph you can do question answering in your research uh your people doing research in pharma and they can really cut down

on the things they need to look at and uh connect efficacy with toxicology and others much more easily much faster uh and this knowledge graph would have extracted

knowledge of millions of documents right so uh that knowledge in papers will be available to you to browse to query to question answer Second is that number of my colleagues here particularly Dr.

Honavar and Shinas Parasa Sadhi they have done original work in um uh drug development molecular uh small molecule design part of it and so for example uh uh you know uh Dr. Hunawar works on

diffusion model when enabled by knowledge graph uh can you know be applicable in a relatively short term. The third is um uh clinical uh you know data collection and clinical trial

leader support. So AI is used for workflow uh understanding quality of data collected ensuring FDA uh you know uh requirements are satisfied. So the likelihood of any FDA coming back and

say you are missing this or that or uh conditions were not right you would reduce that part. The fourth is uh uh production quality. uh so for example I have worked on uh automating uh in

manufacturing environment where uh lots of parameters are uh collected by sensors and whatever observational one and you can find uh rare uh exceptions you can find uh root cause analysis you

can do replanning of your uh current automated flow. So and the final uh one is um regulatory compliance. So we can um take regulatory documents uh create a knowledge graph from that uh which is

process knowledge and then uh help you implement such that whatever you're doing um uh you can uh you know is compliant with the regulation. So converting all these documents that you

have to read into structured representation of knowledge and use it for uh comp you know uh your process flow plus automatically filling out the forms and checking the validate forms.

These are kind of lowhanging fruits that also we can work on. So these are some of the things that our team already is aware of it. Some of the things things we have done some of the things we think

we can do in one two years. uh and um our idea is to work with IPA in the first year and uh you know in the near term understand what the industry the 30 23 members of IPA uh has what what is

their priority which we going to do in the afternoon at least we kick off the process and then uh you know start working hopefully uh on projects that can be shared by the whole ind you know

membership or work on also ones that they want to do because they have proprietary knowledge they want to work on inflammation or they want to work on uh you know some other class of drugs

and they want to do it separately. Uh so either of the way we'll try to understand how we want to move with the help of IPA and BCG uh and uh you know that's the idea right and

&gt;&gt; thank you Dr. appreciate for sharing that. Obviously a lot of exciting opportunities in both you spoke about discovery development. Let me actually turn it over to Sherville now to

actually hear the voice in terms of you know what are the pharma companies looking at. So Sherbill as you think about your own organization and where you feel there are opportunities more in

the near term um you know if you could talk about you know from what you heard from Dr. and more generally where do you see practical measurable outcomes where you would like to deploy AI uh in

the near term and maybe also um you know after that in the longer term. &gt;&gt; Thanks Brianka. So um I think as many organizations you know we all keep uh sort of toying with the idea of

how do we use AI AI is the buzz word today and uh while we have sporadically been doing a lot of things uh let's say use cases or test cases across uh many areas but we have never run

enterprisewide uh solutions like we do when we use SAP or any other ERP system. So I think as an organization we feel that it's necessary now to run AI as a enterprisewide solution rather than just

doing peacemail activity. Having said so uh you know we are responsible for our profits and uh revenue and more importantly patient lives. So we also have to see where we will see the

maximum value uh that we can create. So for for us uh or for generally I would say the first is definitely compliance regulatory quality. I think these areas do offer a lot of opportunity using AI.

Uh I look at it this way. Uh whenever we have a batch failure or whenever we have to file uh a regulatory submission, a lot of effort and time goes in writing and reading and and making sure the

document is of in order. I think AI definitely can solve for it because today the issue with the regulatory responses is not about science is more about documentation. So AI can

definitely solve for that documentation and instead of spending hours on variation filing and doing other regulatory work, we can replace it I would say by using AI language models,

other models to make sure that what we're replying to is compliant and we're not bypassing anything but more importantly uh speeding up the process. I think the second is uh manufacturing

and uh operations and quality. I think there's tremendous opportunity with using AI and automation uh together to improve productivity to reduce the footprint uh of facilities uh to reduce

time to market uh and all of these things will help both on terms of the environmental goals but also on terms of the quality goals. So a lot of times we're doing uh something called the

golden batch. We're talking about predictive analysis. Today most of the quality metrics are when something fails and then we become very good at finding the reasons when something fail. But I

think uh using AI we could definitely see how do we prevent some of these uh losses or some of these deviations or some of these failures that we get to see and I think that can be a very

meaningful uh value for the company because that really improves the quality metrics for the organizations and as Zidus we also want to spend a lot of time to make sure that we have first

time right we have the right batches coming out we have the golden batch rule that comes out we have better uh lesser kapas that we need to take So lesser documentation that we need to manage and

we see tremendous uh productivity gains at least 30 to 50%. In doing so and that's what we want to aim for. So our shift is how do we be more preventive rather than reactive in most of what we

do in the manufacturing and that's one area where AI can be very helpful. And then obviously R&amp;D everybody talks about the big promise of R&amp;D. I I come from an R&amp;D background. I also do believe that

there is great promise but it is not short-term. Uh and uh so while we try and make sure that we get the quick wins uh where we want to we also have to work on seeing how we use R&amp;D to different

areas. I mean we have looked at how do we do more indications for a particular drug. How do we improve the width or the you know how much more can we see with the drug in terms of solutions? uh how

do we optimize so many leads or some of the leads that we have and I think it will help us expand the whole space of research uh but anyway the final call is obviously with the scientists and the

research people who really make that call but more importantly it will build a lot of capabilities to do things faster uh which is very important in R&amp;D uh and

build strong credibility doing so I think these are some of the things that I think will be very important for us and uh our view is that we should scale AI meaningfully in the company. I know

some of these things that are challenging but it is possible today with uh the use cases that we get to see. So that's what the endeavor is going to be for the organization.

&gt;&gt; Thanks uh Sher for sharing that perspective. Um you spoke about documentation, productivity first time right and and also then R&amp;D. Maybe Vinslow I can have you come in uh right

now not uh from your India lens but from all the years that you've spent uh globally with Lily what where have you seen companies like Lily leverage AI uh of course there's a lot more focus on

you know discovery there but what are some of the learnings now that you spent time in India that you think glo you know from your global experience can be leveraged in India uh using AI.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. I think there's two things when we uh look at AI that are very exciting particularly from the industry perspective. one um I think of it from both sides. It speeds innovation. How

can we get innovation to the market but it also helps us to deliver a more personalized experience for uh patients and that's something that so it's across the value chain. Um there's a lot of

discussion around discovery development and so forth. I won't talk a ton about that. I do want to focus one thing though as we think about our global capability centers. What we are seeing

is a big investment and we just opened one in Hyderabad. all about tech AI um AI has to be built on data and that data has to have a governance and a foundation and these centers are a great

way for us to establish that in India and then export that across our organization. So that's really where our focus is as we start to think from the commercial uses which I find very

exciting is it allows us to look at data in a different way. Um, one of our biggest challenges is how do we speed getting our products to the patients and how do we identify where they are? And I

know that there's a lot of data, but as we start to think about how we're using that data to identify where patients are, identify patients in their specific needs, and then how do we communicate

them with them on a medical perspective, leveraging our teams from a sales perspective to give them better insights to translate that to patients. And then ultimately where I think we should be

looking as an industry is how do we get more interoperable data in India um so that we can then have more real world data that has the quality for payers and for regulators. If we can unlock that

then we can move from manufacturing scale to really value innovation and I think that's the true opportunity in a long term that we have right now. One of the things we're looking at in India to

be quite frank is when I was in the US uh heading our commercial business because of the about uh the amount of data because of the connectivity of that data it was very easy to apply AI to

what we do commercially what I'm finding in India is that infrastructure needs to be built having said that even without that infrastructure there's a lot that we can do and I don't think that

infrastructure is just us it's the healthcare industry it's thinking about uh health records it's thinking about other players within the industry. Um uh we are doing a lot of B2B um

partnerships and with hospitals with um uh uh pharmacies and so forth. I think if we can unlock that there's great uh promise to take it not just from discovery right through to how do we get

pro products um approved regula regulatory perspective? How do we monitor safety but then also how do we make sure that those innovations impact patients ultimately No. Uh, thanks a

lot. Uh, Winslow, that's a good segue to my next question to Mr. Jen. Uh, Mr. Jen, Winslow spoke about some of the more data infrastructure. You talk often to the government. If you could talk

about, you know, from a government's perspective, what are they focusing on? Maybe elucidate a little bit more. I know they've spoken a lot about clinical trials and making India a hub for that.

Uh, so if you could talk about government's priorities, but also a little bit more on clinical trials uh using AI. &gt;&gt; So, thank you very much. Priyanka and

it's a privilege to be part of this panel discussion. It will be starting point of a very big agenda for vict uh I remember and select it. IPA started thrust on quality 10 years back and we

set up quality forum. Now is the thrust on AI and innovation and we will take that agenda forward. Today afternoon we have everyone from IPA coming together and we have also the advantage today

Lily joining us for this discussion. Lily is the number one company in the world with 1 trillion market capitalization nearing it and they are playing a very important role in

innovation. I will just put some of the data points. The largest investment in the world in any area is in healthcare. more than defense more than education we spend around 10% of world spending on

healthcare and the critical issue for healthcare whenever you talk of spending defense is around 3 to 4% education is 3 to 4% and in India also if I took private

healthcare expenditure it is around 4 and a half 5%. The critical issue whenever we talk of healthcare expenditure is access of healthcare and second is innovation. India has done

tremendously well on affordable access. As Priyanka was saying we supply 20% of world medicine but as far as innovation is concerned we are way behind. So AI is affordable innovation at a scale and if

we can begin that journey AI affordable innovation at scale that will be a big starting point. Yes we will keep on building on quality and manufacturing quick wins as Shville pointed it out. We

are working separately on it but the other agenda which we have to take forward is affordable innovation and that is again the priority and Shville has been playing a very important role.

Government has announced in the recent budget uh they have announced clinical trial centers thousand clinical trial centers. Although globally we hold 17% of world population but we do only 1%

clinical trial in this country. Big big opportunity to take this agenda forward. The issues which are there are patient enrollment takes more than one year time compared to 3 months in China. Our

compliance rate for patient enrollment is very very low. 70% of money in drug discovery is in clinical trials and we are way behind and that's why many of IPA companies they will do clinical

trials abroad than in India. So there's a big big opportunity and maybe both IPA companies as well as OPI companies can take this agenda forward. How do we build clinical trial space as such which

is very very important in addition to quality and manufacturing where the quick wins will be there identify the specific project take the agenda forward. uh health minister yesterday in

this summit announced two areas. One is AI in healthcare he announced in this bath mandam yesterday and he also announced open data uh systems and that will become very very important the

point which pyanka becomes very very important we are Aadhaar card the kind of data set which we have generated 1.4 4 billion Aadhaar card holders. Uh we have done a great job in UPI but as far

healthcare database is concerned we have about 500 million users of Abha card but only 5 million usage is there. So unless we build a data system and that is what Minslo was talking about. How do we

encourage and build a data state and then India can be using that data state for discovery and innovation in many of the healthare systems. Thank you. Thank you uh Mr. Jen. I think lots of

interesting points on the opportunity uh in terms of productivity in terms of speed to market. Maybe time to shift gears a little bit to the challenges and how we can overcome those. Uh so Sher

let me start with you. You spoke about a lot of opportunities and where you feel you know AI can unlock productivity but as you look inside what are the challenges that you feel uh you know

need to be overcome or today are holding your teams back in moving forward? So even before we started um talking about adopting to AI this was the first um point and the first is always data

people uh have illusions of data uh in organizations. Um we always have the data but there's a trust deficit when it comes to the data set. The second is data also lies in

silos. Uh you know I say sometimes power is with knowledge, knowledge is comes from data. So there is all these silos and inconsistencies that exist in organizations and so it becomes very

difficult because of uh there is no single version of truth when it comes to some of the things that we do because of our broken processes and lot of times you know in the end the the people who

have to review something don't trust it well enough and if you don't trust it then whatever comes out of any tech part is just a PowerPoint presentation and never anything that you can execute. So

I think it's very important that we create uh an environment where we get the right in amount of data and we make sure that it is available and and is more um democratized to make sure that

we can use it in the right way and uh we don't have a shortage of data. It's just a question of that we don't have this belief that that exists in the right way. The second I

see um and this is through the journey on the last one year is this addiction to do pilots. Every time we talk about uh adopting to something there's this whole idea let's

do a few pilots and in pharma or in in our we are very used to this idea of pilots because in drug and anything to do with new molecules anything we are very cautious we want to test something

till it fails uh rather than saying let's you know whatever we have let's move ahead with it and it's sometimes indefinite in terms of how we do things so I think that becomes a very very big

issue And most of the time these pilots fail because there is no leader or there is no owner of this and I think somebody told me that um AI without an owner is like an expensive demo and uh we don't

want to go through these expensive demos in the organization. So there is a strong need for ownership and accountability which is required and that helps. And the third is I think

there is we talk about AI and data scientists and other aspects. We talk about the people who manage the critical functions in the organization but we have a gap of people who can translate

between uh what is AI how does can be used and how the data can be fed in. So the hardest part is not about getting AI engineers or getting about people. It's about how do you have the right people

motivated as translators in the organization who can move some of these capabilities and that is definitely a talent gap because people are still learning the benefits and technology on

AI. So that becomes very difficult and that's the hardest part I would say that we need to overcome. Thank you. &gt;&gt; No uh thank you very relevant points. Maybe let me uh you know talk a bit more

ask Dr. Shet to talk a bit more about data. I think we've all spoken about trust in data. Dr. Shet as I was reading some of your work the approach that you use talks about explanability and trust.

So in the work that you've done if you could talk about how you've overcome some of these challenges that all the panelists here are talking about um so that both at the organizational level

but at the industry level you know more could be adopted. Um, &gt;&gt; AI is driven by data. &gt;&gt; However, AI is also now helping with the

quality of the data a lot more. Um, just as an instance u uh this week s uh last week serum announced the quality of improvement in um OCR uh in different languages. uh but let's say it's English

or let's say it's uh any of the region language there is substantial improvement in how we can convert legacy data into digital data and do further quality check

um technological help is there what Dr. You know Shville talked about in the context of human part of it the leadership part of it that challenge remains the decision making and you know

ownership and willingness to uh set up the process and then believe in that process. Other very important issue about the trustworthy of data that's a very important uh line of work that my

own group has done quite a bit of and it comes down to the following. um we um when you take generative AI is basically all blackbox technology. So uh virtually you

can hardly do anything where you can uh create an AI process that is uh explainable to a user to the right user. So suppose I'm using AI in uh in in uh uh medicine then the doctors need to be

able to it should be explained in the form of doctor. So there we follow the uh new generation of AI we call it's called neuros symbolic AI. So the neuro part is what you see in the um uh in the

um current gen AI. So essentially at a very high level explanation is that you uh learn patterns from the data and you create what is called as this large parametric space but it is

probabilistic. So there is no definitive understanding of what the data is. there is a pattern from the data that is out there and when question is hit against that parameter space you can create

something uh where you have learned how to write that looks to human very very uh you know humanlike and in that case you can trust nevertheless there is no way of repeatability and there is uh no

let's say there's language natural language processing but there is no lang natural language understanding understanding comes by grounding it into the um uh uh into the way in the

vocabularies that humans use. So in our mental health example uh in a project we create a knowledge graph from D uh um uh uh from the medical literature that is used DSM5 is one aspect of it for

training medal health personnel. Now when we give the explanation uh using this neurosy symbolic method symbolic part comes from that knowledge

graph then the terms used are the terms that doctors are trained for right so uh water retention in a body part versus edema right and so giving the appropriate terms and uh making sure

that is indeed edema is not water outside the body uh that kind of uh uh you understanding system has and that can be applied that makes the things very

trustworthy. I'll give you one more example in the when you want to make trustworthy you have to a uh do this human level explanation other is safety we all have heard about uh you know say

suicide uh teens have uh you know gone through suicide because of uh their conversation with this uh large language models. Well um when we develop our uh uh co-pilot for mental health we took

care of medical knowledge that for a MDD major depressive disorder uh in the conversation you do not want to bring up suicidability. So in our knowledge base we would have

knowledge that um in this context this is no no. And so when if you use a regular LLM it will ask questions it does not understand the context of MDD it will ask question uh that will be uh

you know uh suicid that will bring up suicidability and that's bad doctor would not do that so we will prevent the question that question we will modify the question such that it belongs to

that and then there are other things one I'll say one last thing uh and that is called alignment so um in the uh human world in the society we have some regulations, we have some policy, we

have some laws, right? We have some guidelines and somehow we have to follow that in driving we have to follow some guidelines more in west less in India but we do um now uh alignment would mean

that the AI not just like human would also follow those guidelines. So if I have medical guidelines for diagnosis, medical guidelines for treatment, I would represent that in the symbolic

form and this neuros symbolic approach would make sure that those guidelines are consulted and is adhering to those guidelines not doing the things that you would do without the context in a LLM or

in a neural network based system. Right? So uh the ecosystem the new set of techniques that are coming in the picture and which uh we started working on in 2016

uh are giving us uh next generation of AI which uh IRO by the way is building we are building a platform on the top of infrastructure to create models that are more trustworthy in the way I described.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Sh. what I'm what I'm taking away that uh the problems of data and trust in data can certainly be overcome with the new um techniques that are there. So maybe let me then ask a

question on the second topic you mentioned char which is leadership and winslow maybe I can ask you both in your India commercial operations and growth and in your operations in GCC how are

you thinking about taking pilots to scale how are you thinking about leadership so that you can create real impact &gt;&gt; thank you um

&gt;&gt; I really like the comment around pilots and not driving it I think you have to have a clear view of what the organization is trying to achieve with AI. Um we do that um on a functional

level. We know what we're trying to do from a you know research perspective within um commercial where I spend a lot of my time. We know how we're applying it and not just how we're piloting it

but what is the roadmap to what we believe is working now. How do we scale that across the organization? How do we get our teams to adopt that? And I think that's one of the largest challenges as

leaders. You can have a clear strategy, but how do you do the change management so that the teams understand how they're going to adopt it and bringing them along in the journey? I'll just give a

very clear example um uh where um I've seen this from a couple of different organizations, but just as we were thinking about adaptive targeting, how do you get a sales representative or

even a medical uh professional to understand that this is a tool that is actually trusted as we talked about and is going to allow you to be even more effective. And so I think giving them

that understanding and how it's going to fit into their work flow is really important. And so that's a lot of what we're spending time on. Additionally, I think there's also from a leadership

perspective, we have to be honest about how we're driving. Many of the GCC scaled on FTEEs. That's the that's the last way that any new f new uh organization is thinking about it. And

work is increasing. And so when we think about AI and automation and how we're going to apply it, it's not to say that we're going to decrease, but we're going to increase our capacity. And I think

that is for leadership challenges to say be very clear about what we're doing. be very clear about what the outcome is and bring your teams along in a very transparent way so that you can

ultimately get there. Last thing I will say is a measurement of it is critically important. Is it working? Are we getting the outcome we want and then if not how do we change that and then take that

pilot and and make it something that's actually going to work. And so those are some of the challenges that we have from a leadership perspective. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you. Thanks a lot Winslow. I

think you what you mentioned around integrating into workflow and change management I fully resonate with that. Um Mr. Jen maybe we can you know I can ask you to talk I think you heard the

perspectives from both um you know um in slow shar but if I now ask from an ecosystem perspective what would be your wish that if a few gaps from the ecosystem building blocks could be fixed

over the next few years the whole industry uh could benefit and leap forward. uh so two areas which are very important one is we have to go to IC harmonization in terms of regulatory

system uh because that will give us global credibility to move forward in that agenda that is a very very high priority as far as IPA OPI and all the companies are concerned if you start IC

process for clinical trials and those system it will take around 2 years and if you get into quality manufacturing it will take around five to six years. So that's point number one. Point number

two is data is fragmented at this particular moment. There is data lying at IIT's Indian Institute of Sciences. So what we want to do at a macro level and that's why IPA and IRO coming

together is can we play some role in that data integration and that's why what professor state has been talking about and PCG is our knowledge partner. We would like to take that agenda

forward because that will accelerate the journey of going forward as far as AI agenda is concerned and IPA always believes in sharing the best practices. Uh we are creating a platform and shave

and pank Patil who have been proponent of innovation he says let's create a platform let's share the best practice and let's evaluate the progress regularly. So what we are today doing

after this session is creating a platform of AI where companies come together share the successes and how do we move the agenda forward. &gt;&gt; Thank you Mr. Jen. Maybe Sher I'll ask

you to just come in and close beyond what you shared from your company's perspective. Would you like to talk about what would be your wish for the industry from your vantage point of

president of IPA also over the next couple of years? &gt;&gt; Thank you. [sighs] So um I think most I mean I'll start with the

most important point is democratizing uh AI. I think while in uh in our industry we all compete on a day-to-day level but we also collaborate on a day-to-day level and this is one industry uh which

really works together to bring a positive change. So uh I think that has been one key factor in terms of how uh the pharma industry in India has been developed and there are some things that

can help everybody and it doesn't become only a competitive advantage. So you know regulatory intelligence the quality knowledge base that uh Mr. Sudaran Jane was talking about real evidence platform

creating a pool of data that everybody can use. I think all of these things can be done together and we don't need to all duplicate the same effort. uh as companies and if we are able to I think

I say we compete on products but we don't need to compete on anything else. So I think we have to make sure that we can create shared opportunities at Zidus. We also have AI labs and I have

told my team that anything that they develop on the quality on the manufacturing on on some of these processes on regulatory we must make sure their open access is given to other

companies to make sure that if we find it good and successful we should make sure it's more democratized across the industry and it'll really lift the overall industry. I think beyond that is

I think uh I'm sure today there will be a lot of discussion on it but we should at least have 50 good AI cases use cases that we must identify and make sure that as an IPA we take them forward uh and

the outcomes obviously have to have the parameters of time quality compliance and cost and I think that's what we want to drive across uh in the IPA to make sure that the companies champion some of

these uh initiatives of AI and make sure that everything is measurable because what we don't measure we really don't give value to. So it's very important that these are measurable outcomes that

we accept. And the third is um what to what uh Mr. state said also that uh how do we create trust in the area and it's important that AI doesn't become a project but AI becomes an

enterprisewide capability or an operating capability and how do we make sure that both for within my company but also across the right governance the right validation the right uh

explanability of truth or so to say non-h hallucinations that AI should have and importantly the training that needs to get given to all the people in who are working on this becomes very

important. So I think the most important part is in a regulatory industry trust is the real scaling factor and as soon as we can build trust through these uh forums and through these workshops I

think we can see a faster adoption of this capability within within the organizations. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Shervin. I think I'm leaving this panel with a lot of optimism. I

think there's also all of you are showing great confidence that we can uh step forward on the journey from pilots to large scale deployment in the transition from volume based to

innovation value based pharma industry. So thanks a lot all. I think we have just few minutes for maybe one or two quick audience questions. We probably just take one or two.

Uh thank you so much for this session. It was really insightful as a young entrepreneur building in the same space. Uh one thing I missed in this panel and I wanted to ask like as a startup who's

trying to work for such a regulated industry. There's always an inhibition for uh you know a startup coming in and working with uh farmer companies like Zidus. What is your recommendation that

we should do that creates that ecosystem for even startups to burden this sector and help companies to actually use innovative solutions? I don't have an answer but it's a tough

question that you have asked because I think a lot of effort has been put in a lot of work has been done by all of you and it's we get bombarded with uh request and it becomes very very

difficult to see how and what where to give allocate time to so that's definitely a big issue I think the right answer for that uh Mr. Sudashan would be that today we should make sure we create

a portal a platform where some of these gets some some of these leads that get generated through uh reachouts make sure that somebody through the IPA we create a forum where they evaluate and and see

and then propagate it across the IPA members because it just becomes otherwise very very difficult to manage on day-to-day basis. The only other thing I can say is that as in

organizations we as leaders are pushing our people to evaluate ideas and as more and more of this gets done in the company and leadership in the organizations make take AI as the

core centerpiece of how they want to use the their day-to-day I think they will I hope one day reach out back to the startups rather than today the startups making all the effort to to reach out to

the big corporates but we should definitely have an agenda where we can have a sort of a knowledge pool of who which are the new AI startups that are there and what work they're doing and

then as companies find it appropriate should reach out to them but it's a tough one. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you for a great session. U I

I'm Sneighha I work for the healthcare sector. So my u question to all of you is of course um healthcare and particular farmer being such a sensitive uh sector there are a lot of extra

policies that govern us. Now in this situation, how do you think that uh the speed to innovation uh can be done and can AI be part of that? Because I think uh the way AI has uh you know changed in

the last 2 years so many things have evolved in multiple sectors but with pharma or healthcare in particular the time or the speed is not that great. So how do you think we can really speed

this up and we can match to the same uh solutions that are actually available uh even which can help the uh healthcare and pharma sector. &gt;&gt; Uh so thank you very much uh for this

question. And whenever we talk of healthcare, there are issues related to privacy, there are issues related to regulatory environment and how do you balance

that part with deregulation and all of us are aware that government has set up deregulation committee with Mr. Rajiv Kaba as the chairman. Uh so what we are trying to do and in this budget first

time uh you see so much emphasis and clinical trials they've been talking they are talking that how do we simplify our process through approval of drugs and approval of clinical trial

guidelines they match the global standards. Uh that is an intention. Uh second all of us are also aware that government is setting up a newer in CDSO scientific. So both the areas building

the talent base it will take time overall simplifying the processes and moving forward but at the end of the day the critical issue is how do we deal with the privacy issues because when

I've been monitoring creating database in this country and aba aba when I started seeing 500 million uh but the usage is only of 5 million uh lot to be moved as far as that area is concerned

during COVID time we moved very fast with co &gt;&gt; that's true I think that was the only time where I have seen &gt;&gt; very very fast

&gt;&gt; was really highest &gt;&gt; so arish charma who played a role in Aadhaar card he played a very important role for co uh but lot to be taken forward in that area lot to be taken

forward &gt;&gt; so do you think that the policy makers and the providers need more insights and training around the AI uh toolkit that could be available which might just

speed up this whole uh innovation or speed to innovation. &gt;&gt; Uh let me tell you they are much more sensitive and listening to every conversation for last one year. Yeah. Uh

so there's lot of movement forward in that particular space. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. &gt;&gt; Uh I I just have one question uh for AI the most important

&gt;&gt; let's make this the last question. We are almost out of time so we'll just Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Sorry. uh for AI uh information or data is the most critical element. So I

have two questions. One uh India is such a huge country and we all know that data is really diverse. So uh and I I heard from most of you that it's either isolated or it's not connected and we

also have incomplete information despite our own. So what are you know how is it that we would put this information in in place because without this the AI will never be a success for us and two there

are multiple facets to the life science industry discovery R&amp;D manufacturing commercial supply chain uh what I gather from some of you is some of some of these fields will be more advanced and I

believe uh manufacturing is a space where information is still uh pretty good with us then we could put lot of AI but in some of the other pieces so according to all of you where do you

think we will probably be a much more ahead as compared to the other fields in in life science industry sorry &gt;&gt; no so I think you already answered some

of it saying it'll wherever your data is captively held and uh more structured obviously it becomes the easiest one to move forward and the other is uh as I said we have to create partnerships like

IRO is there and others to make sure we create Indian data set Indian knowledge graphs uh you know we as organizations have a lot of phase 3 phase 4 data phicco vigilance data that we collect uh

post marketing surveillance data that we collect which the regulators also hold today so I think there is all of this data that is there and I'm sure over a period of time this will also be a

wealth of data that will get created in fact a lot of uh diagnostic test data is anonymized and available today. So I mean everything is to be is for some you pay for everything what you want to get

for but today I think there is enough data available in the west obviously is highly evolved and structured and already built out in India we need to still go through it and I think it'll be

have to be championed between institutions government and um academia to make sure that some of this gets done but I'm sure as as organizations we would also champion some of these uh

with partnerships like with IRO and others. So that's what we hope to uh do because in the end what we all working for is better patient outcomes and patient lives and while we do all of

this if we don't make any difference in that obviously we have not done much so we hope uh that'll make a difference. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Uh I I think we have more questions than

answers from this session and that just tells what an insightful discussion this was. Uh please give a big round of applause for our speakers. [applause] Uh and quick announcement because we are

on we are you the time is up so I'll request if people want to have conversations to please move out of the room and continue the conversations. Thank you so much.
