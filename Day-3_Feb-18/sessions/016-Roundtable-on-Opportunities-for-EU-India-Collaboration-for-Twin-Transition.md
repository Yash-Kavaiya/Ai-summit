## 📝 Transcript

group science and technology office MAC life science and um my and our dear president Jurgen Westaya of president of FIB and also president and managing director India

and South Asia Airbus we are awaiting the arrival of Mr. Roberto Viola director general directorate general for communications network content and technology EU

commission in another few minutes however we will begin with our program my name is Sonia Prasha I'm the secretary general of FBI and we are very honored to be organizing this round

table on opportunities for EU India collaboration for twin transition two weeks back the mood was euphoric we did it as uh the president of the EU commission said Ursulaf lion We did it

and we did conclude the negotiations on the EU India FDA. Uh there's a lot of work to be done in the next few weeks and months and uh that is why it was also important to discuss the EU India

collaboration for tune twin transition on the occasion of the AI impact summit. I would now like to welcome FAB president Jurgen Westmaya to kindly give his address.

Sorry for not sorry. I think it's a good cozy setup today morning. So please enjoy the coziness in this room and uh please listen to these brilliant remarks today.

&gt;&gt; Oh a lot of pressure brilliant remarks. Let's see [laughter] now. First of all u thank you very much much Sonia for organizing this and thank you everybody for coming. It's an

important event and Um I have two roles as you said, president of FBI, Federation of European businesses uh in India and um yeah it's uh it's exciting times collaboration reaches new heights.

So just if you are a European company in India and not yet a member we definitely take applications today and uh it's uh it's two super important topics u artificial intelligence and

sustainability where we will today see discussions comments from our s teams industry colleagues I'm I'm really excited to see to hear what they are doing how they are driving uh this uh

this twin transitions. A few a few words from from my industry. So this is my my reference point. So for me coming from the aviation industry there for us both of these topics signific

orbital shift in our industrial activity and the way we do business at Airbus. And let me say this because how do we do AI? Um Europe somebody some people say it's the champion of

regulations. So um but it's important at Airbus we also believe that technology should be humanentric. IIA is not a replacement for expertise

rather it is a responsible and ethical enabler designed to augment human capability and Airbus we have comp things like the predictive maintenance we are optimizing

logistics or we also already streamlining complex engineering IIA allows us to move from abstract ambition to practical high impact results

but however technology alone cannot be the goal. The true measure of our success lies in how we apply these technologies to sell solve one of the major existential crisis, global

warming. For any an industry to thrive in the coming decades, sustainability must be embedded into its design and governance from the outset,

not threaded in as an after after sort. We believe we must look at I AI as a bridge, one that helps us to become more efficient and optimize resources on the way to our net zero goals.

At Airbus, we already use AI as an responsible enabler to design to support our people. from our smart engineering assistant supporting 14,000 engineers to the sky platform which already saves

global airline industry over 200 million annually through predictive maintenance. So AI is already delivering tangible results, tangible values but honestly quite small compared to the

ambition we see coming from aviation. the sky is the limit. Um, parallel to this digital revolution is our green transition. Uh, in Elvis, we believe aerospace is a powerful force

for good in an unstable world. So, we want to stay true and we are staying true to what matters most for us, which is our vision. We are pioneering sustainable aerospace for a

safe and connected world. And connected also means digital. For us, sustainability is a strength. It drives innovation. It boosts efficiency and it creates value for the long term.

And for example, here in India [clears throat] um who lives in Delhi knows the air quality especially during during winter. India here possesses the raw materials

from vast agricultural feed stock uh to a world-class engineering talent pool to become the sustainable aviation fuel factory for the world. So just imagine and we have uh research project with

Gati Shaki if we would be able to make it a business case to collect the stubble on the fields rather than to burn it. This would be a major step forward because as long business cases

drives the world as long this is not a business case it will be hard to stop. So this can be the way way forward also key part of made in India saf. So friends, today's round table is an

opportunity to hear how your companies are making the twin transition of AI and sustainability and I'm really looking forward to as you said Sonia brilliant insights. Thank you very much.

[applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jurgen Jurgen Westmay President Febbe. Um before we go to the next address, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to Mr. Roberto Viola,

Director General, Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology, EU Commission. Before I invite you on the DIS, we need an official photograph of all the

speakers. May I please request everybody to uh stand up for the official photograph? I'm coming. I have to also acknowledge the presence of my vice president uh Mr. Deepak

Sharma from Schneider sitting here. So thank you very much for joining. Now uh it's my again pleasure and honor to invite Mr. Roberto Viola for his address please.

&gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Good morning everyone. Thank you very much for the kind invitation. Congratulation for organizing this round table. I apologize to be slightly late.

It is the enthusiast to enter I mean the I summit that slow my my coming to you. It's really a pleasure to be here. uh the fact that uh we in 12 months uh I'm the second this the second time I'm

visiting India just gives you the idea of how important is the EU India relationship for us and I'm I'm sure the same can be said for for the Indian friends at this point in time we uh made

impressive progress in the last 12 months starting exactly last February with the visit of the president of the commission the full college year uh and then with the

senator of the trade agreement historic senator of the trade agreement and today I mean here with the AI impact summit where we come to continue this journey of cooperation.

There are many reasons why EU and India have to be marching together being friends together. Uh we are two great democracies. We see things in similar ways. Uh we want that technology, green

technology, digital technology serves our citizens and improves quality of life and well-being. On this there's absolutely no difference and absolutely we we stand united. Uh clearly uh Europe

uh looking from the dynamic India is a bit oldish and brings I mean enthusiasm brings I mean uh the the force of Europe what we are doing been doing and India brings the dynamism brings the rising I

mean stars of technology and economy so we are in a way together a very strong team Let me uh uh tell you what uh this relationship can bring in the short term, in the medium-term and the long

term. Uh if I start with the short term uh together with the senior of the trade agreement, I personally signed with the met secretary an agreement to mutually recognize e signature between India and

Europe. And this is just the first step as you know I mean the basic cooperation with India is through the trade and technology country. India is the only country where we have a trade and

technology council active. And one of the goals of this trade and technology council is to make sure that uh making business uh from India to Europe from Europe to India becomes much much

simpler and the whole idea is that to make it much much simpler and this I come to the short-term deliverables it has to be all digital. So uh uh Europe has launched a a a project which uh

brings together all what we do in terms of identity senior for companies timestamping all what we call the trusted elements of uh uh around company life and uh this is called the European

business wallet and we have a specific provision that says this can be source of mutual recognition and we have already done the first step with India to recognize now this signature and then

the rest I hope it will come quite quickly. So the whole idea is that uh uh whatever is digitally generated in terms of trust document from an Indian company or from a European company can be

mutually recognized and hopefully this immensely helps in businessto government relationship and businessto business relationship. So this is uh and of course this extends uh to citizens

because uh India has been making impressive progress with the ADAR and the DGLOG uh wallet and we have the in Europe the European uh citizens wallet that will be in the pocket of every

European uh this year. So also the idea is that when it comes to the mobility of citizens, mobility of workers, the personal wallets and business wallet will work seamlessly and hopefully fully

interoperable. I must say with a lot of proud that we have been doing tests of interoperability between the ADAR and European digital wallet and things are very fine. So uh we are very confident

that since there's a strong political will on the two sides and that there's a strong technical underpinning that digital interoperability will be the first big deliverable of our

cooperation. Now looking to the medium term of course we look at AI we have already uh uh a cooperation when it comes to uh high-end AI and supercomputing we signed a cooperation

agreement between the our supercomputing centers and Indian supercomputing centers and we work together already on climate on diseases and the idea now is to move into the

area of uh AI cooperation looking at healthcare, looking at industry, looking at aerospace, looking at material science and pharma. Uh we have just launched a number of challenges in

Europe. As you know, we have a model that is based on the expansion of solid I mean uh compute capacity for industries and for startups. And the whole idea is that we'll work together

with Indian researchers with Indian companies uh trying to get this model which is a bit of a different model all together of AI which is including everyone into the

AI development especially the large European scientific community large uh and startup community the large uh Indian one into an inclusive uh way of looking at things and that of course

includes the two sides. of the economy. uh advancement in IT and AI which also brings I mean advancement in greening and I mean making sure that the sustainability comes with reasonable

cost and uh all the advantages in the in the long term really the the hope and the idea is that we can create a seamless knowledge area between the EU and India uh making sure that this as I

said I mean full digital interpability. Uh sharing the same aims and same ideas about opening our models and opening our supercomputers to cooperative research and ultimately creating this seamless

area of knowledge and trust for greening and making our planet more digital. Many thanks for your attention. Thank you Mr. Roberto Viola for making very important remarks with respect to

the EU India collaboration. Um I would now like to invite some inputs on sector specific AI use cases and sustainability and our first speaker is Dr. Claus Noman global head SAP labs network. over to

you class. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much Sona and dear director Viola and President Btomire of Febbe. It's my great pleasure and honor to speak here today and also to um

represent SAP. Uh we are having of course also a very strong base here in multiple locations. We employ more than 15,000 engineers right now in India and we are still uh growing from there. Now

um I would like to just make very briefly four points. I Sonia already looks at me with a make speak faster. [laughter] So I would like to make just four very

short points uh in my in my opening remarks here. Uh number one is the twin transition itself. Yeah. From SAP's point of view, it is of course uh not only to digitalize uh the the processes

and bring in AI but really to make it AI first and one important concept uh and I was happy that uh director Viola just spoke about the digital wallet is also the so-called green ledger. So that

means how do we make sustainable efforts into financial numbers and then can also report on it in a in a aligned way between India for example uh and the European Union. The second um thing is

of course that we need to drive really uh AI use cases. Yeah. And at SAP we believe in three major ways how to do this. Number one is we need to measure it. Yeah. with software with with AI we

need to measure it then we need to analyze it again we need AI of course uh to analyze it to see what's the insights now and then finally of course to optimize it yeah and then ideally doing

this uh also automatically number three is very clear we need policies and also a regulatory framework here what we have observed is that globally the regulatory framework is

very diverse yeah and I don't mean this only in a positive way. So I we would be of course very happy if we would get to more standards and in the regulation uh across the globe because basically every

country has their own regulations now with respect to AI. I also understand this because AI is also a matter of national concern and national security and not only about optimization and

sustainability. And then it is about sustainable AI infrastructure. Uh very important we need and that's again when we speak about the twin transition AI also uses a

lot of energy. Yeah. according to calculations I just read earlier this week uh for example in the United States right the the usage of AI data centers right is about in four years the same

than the usage of electricity for the whole African continent yeah so you get an idea here's one country that can invest the same amount of money and resources another continent needs to run

the whole continent that gives you an idea what we are talking about when we speak about energy consumption and therefore it is also important that we put every single effort in making AI

more sustainable. This can be of course by optimizing infrastructure by using more green and clean energy but also of course by optimizing the models we are using. We see great effort but the world

again needs to come together. some of the best models are developed in different parts of the world and we see we can reduce energy consumption also in AI by up to 90 95% by using the right

technology. So with that I would hope I gave a few ideas here in my remarks and I wish this conference really very happy proceedings. Thank you very much. Thank you class. Um thank you Mr. Viola

also for your presence today. Uh it's my huge honor um to invite Mr. Olivia Bloom global CEO Schneider Electric. Uh Mr. Bloom, thank you very much for joining us um and making it possible to make

your remarks here as well. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Good morning to all. It's always a pleasure, you know, and a special feeling for me to to be back to India.

I'm not going to tell you my personal life but I I landed for the first time in my life in 2020 2007 and my job was to make Schneider in India big and I spent six years of my life in India and

2007 when I landed and I came with my family you know when you are the head of Schneider in India that time the biggest thing that you discover that that the biggest problem of the country was

access to power and since 2007 I came back to India I would say in average four times per years now I'm the global C of the company I'm standing in front of you and what is the biggest problem

of planet today access to power and uh nothing has changed but the difference is that the problem of power is not only a problem of India it's a problem of the global planet now what is very very

interesting when we speak about AI and we are in an AI summit and you will hear a lot of people talking and if you hear to from the CEO of the largest tech company they will tell you something

very very simple AI is going to transform the world for sure but AI needs compute and the biggest problem to get compute is energy And we have progressed a lot in the past

101 15 years. Let's make it clear. I remember the time you know of the Paris agreement which was somewhere a catalyst for the world to realize that if we want really to decarbonize the planet we need

to manage energy very differently and that's why you started to hear a lot about clean energy clean energy and a lot of focus on supply but many people many people who have done research in

the world and Schneider was one of the company realized that clean energy and working on supply was one aspect but the second aspect which was more important was even the demand side how you make

energy more efficient and the good news since 2015 there are a lot of company there are a lot of people in the world who have started to implement technology that makes energy more efficient and

that's why we move from a world which was about being more electrical to world which was more electrical and more digital so that was a great journey but I don't think we fix the problem of the

planet because in many part of the world today the problem of energy is still there even without talking about AI you have a lot of countries in the world who don't have access to energy in some part

of the day just because you have peak load and we have not been able to manage yet those issues in many many part of the world by the way including in the US we are in many state of the US you are

still facing access to energy now we are in front of a big trend which is the trend and when you look at the type of infrastructure that you need for AI they're very very different that's why

we don't speak anymore about data center we start to speak about AI factories because the type of infrastructure that you need are very And that's really one of the the core business of Schneider

and that's why we're working very very closely with Nvidia. Just to give you a very simple number up to a couple of years with my a couple of weeks or couple of months ago I would say with my

colleagues at Schneider when we are speaking with the largest hyperscaler in the world to be the data center. We are talking about rack density about 10 kilowatt 40 kilowatt that that was a

standard I would say type of density that you have in the data center. Just to give you an example up to 40 kilowatt you can cool a data center with air above 40 kilowatt in average is not

possible anymore. Now when you look at the type of GPU which are coming in the market in the coming years that change completely. You are moving from 10 40 today we are already at 150 when we

designed data center to support AI and we are talking about going up to one megawatt in the coming years that changed completely the infrastructure of data center and of course that require a

very very different type of power infrastructure. Some [clears throat] of of you might have heard of the concept of 800 volt DCs which is a completely new type of electrical infrastructure to

support the data center. Now it's not yet in the market today but it will come in the next three five years. Actually I was in China recently. China will not be the country in the world will face this

new infrastructure. I think it will come in the US first for sure because this is where the highest demand here. But we start to see some design of 800 volt DC in our team that will make it possible.

Now to cut a long story short, what does it mean? On top of a world which was already facing a lot of energy shortage, we are just going to the next level with AI. The big difference between AI and

your home, we can eventually stop access to energy in your home for a couple of hours, even if you don't like it or we can ask you to reduce your energy consumption. That does not work with an

AI factory. It has to be on all the time. Now the good news in all of that if we are able to think about if we're able to if you think about what we've done in the past 1015 years which is to

start to digitize the power systems in the world but if we are able to take it to the next level and to do it seriously I think we have a pass we have a pass really to make AI possible because again

AI needs computes need energy but it means a total different view on how the different players are going to work in the market starting from The government the speed at which government are going

to facilitate all this infrastructure making sure utility are doing a serious job to digitize their own also infrastructure and having a complete different view on a power system which

will be completely digitized and in which you can really make it efficient and why I'm a much more optimist today than I was 15 10 years ago it's because AI is part of the solution we always

said that AI needs energy but energy needs its intelligence. So when we look at where we are today and especially in this country, if we are able to make energy intelligent, what does it mean?

I'm going to give you a very simple example and I'm going to close. Look at your home today. Today you have an electrical panel in your home. This electrical panel is not connected home

you don't realize is the largest consumption of energy in the world. Imagine a world where every single home are connected where we are able to extract data. We are able to apply an AI

agent or we can run the consumption in your home without you knowing it. You can save up to 20 to 30 20 to up to 30% of the energy consumption in home and you don't even know it because today you

are not in your right now you are not in your home but your home continue to work on energy. So the technology will take us to a very very different level what we call energy intelligence that help to

solve this equation between AI and energy because again AI is part of the solution to make energy more intelligent and I would just conclude being India India is a unique opportunity because

India in the world a place where you have a lot of engineers in power and automation more and then anywhere else in the world. I've been working in this country for six years. I can tell you

when you crack the code in India, you crack the code for the planet because this is where you have the biggest pressure on infrastructure because of temperature because of of everything. So

if you crack the code here, you you solve it for the planet. And three, it's a digital country, digital native country because that's a place where we have the largest number of software

engineers. It's interesting you know Schneider is doing the largest part of its business in in data center but also in digital in the US but the largest number of software engineers that we

have in the world are in this country. So when you combine all of that the need for power the competencies we have in the country. I think AI really will move probably much faster in this country

than anybody else in the world and that will give us a lot of ideas on how we can implement those solution in different part of the world. So I'll stop here because I've been probably

already very very long. So what I just want to leave it to you is energy needs to become more intelligent. I'm very optimist. It's possible and that can help also to solve all our

decarbonization goal that we have at the same time. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. I can use the word brilliant here. Brilliant. [laughter] Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I now like to invite Dr. Magnus Everbrink, head of advanced technology and CTO Airpac Ericson Group. Good morning everyone. Pleasure to be here. Pleasure to talk about innovation

India and EU. Now going forward AI it's of course there in many ways. AI and cloud but then as a representative of Ericson and the telecom industry the mobile networks without them you

wouldn't be able to connect your application to the cloud and have the compute being done it is a bad necessity and that importance will ever increase. Being without it is not an option.

Regardless where you are in the office, at home, out and about, you need to be connected and you will rely on it. And you is not only a consumer, its industries, its enterprise, its

government sectors. And indeed that journey is onwards now. It's happening. I'm very proud to be here in India. One of the nations, one of the few nations I highlight as I travel in much

of Asia and in the world for having this ability is India with the fifth generation. Reliance, GU and ATEL have internationally fantastic good systems and that is a platform to continue to

leverage on leverage on together with Indian initiatives of the digital stack. UPI and and digital ID are just few tokens there that are fundamental to drive digitalization in society. I'm

being a Swedish citizen. I live in Asia and as a fellow European, I'd say to my European friends here, there are many good things to keep an eye on in India and the next few years with this

platform. Applying AI ever more on it and deriving more information will drive further society wealth. Some examples of what? Well, we see it now with the fifth generation going

beyond consumer is having a best effort connection as we used to to having tailored connections to the needs of a consumer of an enterprise industry government functions.

New York City policemen today wear body cams. T-Mo USA connect them through the 5G system with a dedicated service for that need. There's no staggering. A live stream of the video is immediately being

broadcasted to the home server. In other words, there's a public record. How did the policeman treat the citizen? How did the citizen treat the policeman? There's no more arguing. There's a

record for the good of society. That's just one token of how a government function relies on a service procured in a private network with a certain guarantee for that service and it starts

to drive extra value in society. Already in the USA the um national carriers the mobile operators provide information to financial companies so that fraud can be minimized the economic

value of that of course is very very large and it's starting there it will spread through the world I'm based in Singapore where many examples there the national airport the national port all

being 5G connected luggage handling management of containers is done in a secure, safe and reliable way through the the 5G implementation. The Hyundai car manufacturing site in

Singapore, they use 5G internally in their factory. The service is produced on a public network, but it's a private service, safe and secure. When you use a automatic screwdriver to

fasten a tool bolt, connectivity is through 5G and all data are automatically logged in a database. They know individually every bolts tightened in one car. How

was that made? Five years from now, is there faults? They can identify every vehicle that may have a reason to be called back. not go on a serious and year basis. They can pinpoint individual

cause. Last example, the National University Hospital in Singapore, a set of surgeons now over three years are using 5G connectivity to use XR imagery to

superimpose as they do surgery. Ahead of surgery, they do a digital twin. As they cut the body open, they have an XR visor on looking into the patient and it superimposes for them where is the

cancer tumor on the liver. Thanks to that, they can make a precision cut. Cut less of the liver but cover all of the tumor. The fact is 20 to 30 time%

shorter surgery time, lower mortality rate and faster recovery time. In other words, for any factory, quality up, efficiency up, thanks to using AI based algorithms or imagery

and having the 5G secure connectivity. Okay, you can argue that's a few surgeons that use this five days a week in one hospital, but I'm sure you know Rayban, Meta, many

other companies are working on glasses that are becoming XR glasses. Just imagine in a few years time for many of you who have traveled in here to Delhi, you come to Delhi for

maybe the first time and you have these glasses, you will automatically see which building you're looking at. If you'd like to listen to somebody talking in Hindi, you have it automatically

translated real time thanks to AI support in the network and being connected. But the connectivity needs to be there and it's just a few few year to years

down the line. In other words, innovation is happening now. The next few years the networks the nation that are maturing 5G will drive AI based innovation on these networks.

India is fantastically pegged for this. The 100 5G networks that Modi initiated uh some three years ago is a great foundation for this one out of many tokens.

Driving innovation on 5G now gives nations a leading edge till the end of this decade as we merge into the next generation. So go all in now. Think India do well to

the European Union continue as well. that will give a better position end of the decade drive digitalization in every society. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Hebrink for again

brilliant remarks. U we have now Mr. Christian wicket uh head of global digital policy group science and technology office mac life science. &gt;&gt; Good morning everyone. Thank you Febe

for the invitation. So Mer is a science and technology group right a lot of you know uh MER by the pharmaceutical side but it's also very strong in life science and in electronics basically

chemicals gases and processes force and conductors um we talk a lot uh about AI and I'll just distill a little bit here of what we are doing so we are in the context of

bio convergence so what we used to do in terms of biology and chemistry now converges with data science and AI and that is really transforming everything that we do. uh folks talk a lot about

LLMs and the big models but if we think about the the theme of this event here the impact summit uh we believe that the biggest impact will come from industrial AI and industrial AI is already

transforming the whole value chain of biotech. Um for example things that we are doing if we think about right the beginning of the value chain on drug discovery. So we

developed uh tintia a model on drug discovery that you can design the molecules uh we have uh Edison as well and basically both those two models create a

new uh AI for drug development and that evolved to uh digital lab. So we have now our uh fully digital lab uh in Berica and we are working and transforming it to be

autonomous and really leverage and what what impact will bring it will reduce cost it will accelerate the discovery so it will really transform and actually I believe this year 2026 is the first year

that we'll have AIdriven drugs drugs in clinical trials. So we start seeing the results of all that um not ME specifically but we provide to many of the pharmaceutical companies. Um with

that with the lab of the future you can evolve as well to synthropy. Synthrop is a joint venture that we have with Palunteer focused on building this trusted data layer uh where can break

the silos and people can share data controlling IP controlling cyber security we don't own any data it's completely in the control of the users but really to ferment to create this

foundation where people can uh develop on top then on manufacturing itself we have developments on smart manufacturing and digital twins uh that will again transform how everything is produced

with uh uh uh all the concerns of sustainability and all of that. So as you can see the whole biotech ecosystem is transforming uh we have products and solutions that can partner and can uh u

help India as well. And uh if I think about it, if I think about what uh what India could do with all the talent you have and all the great foundation that India has in pharmaceutical in life

science. Uh really investing in this foundation, invest in this data layer and onpology and you can let the entrepreneurship and the frugal uh business grow and be creative on top of

that and leverage all the skilled talents. To link a little bit one minute on the uh sustainability part, we launched uh recently our performance computing center in Munich. Uh it's 100%

uh fueled by uh renewable energy has water cooling and all uh green solutions there run by um our own uh Nvidia Blackwell chips uh in a partnership with Equinix and Lenovo. So indeed it's

fermenting and it's accelerating everything. is transforming everything that we do and we have been doing for 357 years. Um and India has tremendous potential and I believe that this EU

India connection will be transformative and key around the globe. So thank you I'm not sure. Okay, it's working. Thank you very much for your comments. Um, before we go to some u uh points from

the audience, if the panel would like to make any additional comments, please. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I thank you. Thank you very much. So yeah, just one very short one because when I was listening to my co-panelists

uh here, I think one super important theme that really combines this industry is also at the core of this conference is certainly the notion of trust. Uh because we have the most beautiful AI

systems at SAP, at Schneider, Airbus and so on. But at the same time, if our customers, if the people don't trust it, don't trust the analysis and the results, it's all pretty useless. And

this trust is also not into the system only but also between governments. I mentioned it. We have large nations and also regions EU, India. I think it must be trustbased and this is the core of

the discussion and that's also I believe the core of this whole conference. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. trust uh good comment uh and maybe need to be combined

with cyber security because I think it is energy 30% savings uh if AI controls your home excellent but if this is not trustfully protected with the right cyber security it can also be a

nightmare so all these things needs to come together &gt;&gt; well look I've spoken a lot already the only thing I would say if you look at the history of the world technology has

brought progress to many people in the world. That's why I always like to look at the bottle of full versus empty. And if we look at India, look at what was the country 40 years ago, 20 years ago,

10 years ago, technology has brought progress to every single people in this country. So I would like really that we think about of course security about trust and everything, but that we

embrace AI in a way that can bring progress for all. And I'm really really convinced that it's going to transform a lot the way we educate people, the way we curate people, the way we bring a lot

to many people in the world. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um to um tag on here um security, resilience, robustness are fundamental and that's that's huge. You have to fix that, right? If you

don't have that going forward, you cannot even try to be trusted. then trust goes way beyond that. It it is really a judgment from the individual organization.

Um and that's something that needs to be won I thought I think and and that's that's needs to work on and can never be compromised but it will be ever so important.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. And building on trust that was uh said here. So we also believe in in ethics and that's a key element to build trust. We have our code of digital ethics. So all the AI products and

services that I mentioned here they have to comply with our code of digital ethics. We have a digital ethics advisory panel with civil society academia members of the industry. So I

believe those uh initiatives having ethics by design right in the beginning make it a little bit independent of regulation and country really the foundation is set to grow and build

trust. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much for the family. &gt;&gt; The clock is ticking there but uh we will have very quick comments from the audience please. This

we will keep it uh later. I have uh Mr. Proomote Koshik from Hexagon also one of the FAB members. Uh very quickly in exactly half a minute, how can AI solutions be

effectively deployed across manufacturing ecosystem in a way that addresses the distinct needs of both large enterprises and MSMES enabling smarter automation, better decision-

making and scalable operational improvements? &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a it's a large question but yes, I'll do my invest in 30 seconds. it is that you know of course at large

enterprise versus this MSMES in the country which are giving 45% export and there backbone of the economy we have solutions which are actually robotic uh you know in nature basically we have

developed a humanoid uh robotic system for the large enterprise which works along with the uh I would say the workers and the very complex workflows which are there it it is very very aware

of the surroundings things it learns while it's doing the job and it's absolutely for any hazardous location or any of the which are tough ergonomically situations it does a fantastic job for

the large enterprises because this humanoid uh robotic system is doing a wonderful job and we are getting a very good traction coming on MSMES small enterprise you know they depend the ROA

has to be very you know very fast and they can't spend so much of money like large enterprise can do it but the fact remains is that we have a systems for the all India is growing big way on the

I will say multiaxis CNC machines and machine tools and there we have developed an AI system which is based on machine learning which does the entire CAM programming based on the AI it

learns from all the historical program which have been written what has been the tool path which how the tools have to be chosen and then it does fantastic job on the manufacturing to do a job

which is highly reliable and very precision and does a good ROI. Thank you. So very much u Dr. Li Shana you in any case we please be here because you have to wrap up the session. Um very

quickly Ajit Mehoth from NXP how can NXP uh how is it NXP seeing u to add value in the context of AI on edge? &gt;&gt; Yeah NXP's mission statement is to bring intelligent systems to the edge. So we

heard all the panelists talk about power of running um AI applications in the cloud and our goal is to bring AI applications closer to the end user uh ranging from applications that need

microwatts to tens of watts and not gigawatts or megawatts of power. So in that process we're also able to help the environment. For example, we are partnering with our company called

Ozone, which does ocean cleanup and is able to use AI applications to detect uh ocean waste and be able to collect it. Similarly, for smart agriculture, we have several applications that help uh

sustainable agriculture and and and effective use of uh fertilizers using AI applications. So, our mission statement is to bring AI closer to the end user in a way that doesn't need megawatts of

power. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you, Dr. Sha to wrap up the session. Uh we'll take the comments. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Uh uh good morning

everyone. Uh I'm Lavnish and I work for SEP and I also chair the digital economy committee. My name is not Sonia Parisher. You know she made me sit. Actually we have uh done a fantastic

work of discussing technology not only in vacuum but a twin transition of linking uh digital with sustainability that is the interwoven uh digital and sustainability agenda. Obviously all of

us came here with the thought process on uh the unprecedented scale that India offers and the regulatory framework that EU and what can be done. We have the resilient uh supply chains and the

sustainable frameworks. Since the word is brilliant uh today which Sonia coined let me summarize the whole discussion that's what I have been told to do in this word brilliant only I think in this

word brilliant the B as it came out from the panel is this whole need for bilateral benchmarking that is we need to actually do the alignment of the EU regulatory frameworks with India's

digital scale to set global interoperable standards that's the B the R in the brilliant stands for responsible resilience. That's the R that is building AIdriven supply chains

that are ethically sound and we heard uh from Airbus that that this can only happen at the design stage. You heard that in terms of designing stage. I frankly came as a word to me that is

innovating the impact and that is where fact you know focusing on sector specific AI use cases that highlighted from and and then we heard from Erikson on the various use cases L was

leveraging R&amp;D leveraging research and we also heard the co-creation of twin transition solutions from from multiple panelists then the other L to me was the low carbon ledgers that is we now need

to measure the green line in addition to top line and bottom line and that's where we have uh the next wave of uh then we have the I that is the inclusive interoperability and we also heard from

EU European Commission the plans the short-term midterm and the long-term plan of integrating and interoperating the industrial identity as well as the national identity and what we heard on a

is accelerating the action and and um our panelist from Merc mentioned the need for industrial AI as the vehicle to move forward in terms of the accelerating action. N obviously is net

zero networks uh and I love the statement coming from uh Mr. Oliver that AI needs energy and energy needs intelligence. I think that's where the net zero networks uh and finally t as

all panelists said is the trustbased transition. That's the trust base that uh we are looking for given that I sitting there I created four lines using AI and I want to end with that that from

bhat mandapam a vision can take flight from bhat montapam a vision can take flight where green goals and digital power can unite with India's vcale and EU's clear mind a sustainable future is

what all of us can find thank you so much for the &gt;&gt; So again once [laughter] again ending with a very very brilliant wrap-up. So thank you ladies and gentlemen. We had

to do it very quickly because the next session is going to start but you will have a chance to interact outside the room and yeah.

Yeah.
