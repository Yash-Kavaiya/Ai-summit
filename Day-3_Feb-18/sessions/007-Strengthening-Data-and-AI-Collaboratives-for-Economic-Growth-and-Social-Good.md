## 📝 Transcript

Thank you everyone. I would request to kindly take your seats. Again a very warm welcome to all of you. I am Nupura and on behalf of civic data lab we would welcome you all for an

engaging session on strengthening data and AI collaboratives for economic growth and social good. The last two days have been very meaningful conversations aiming towards potential

collaborations. But what do what do these collaborations entail? Especially around the context of data and AI. There have been a lot of questions in terms of how do these collaborations will shape

further. Is this the collaborations around the shared data infrastructures, shared tools, ethics or the governance practices altogether? To unpack these questions, we have a great lineup of

speakers to share their perspective and their experience on the various aspects of strengthening data and AI collaboratives. A quick walkthrough of today's uh format of the session. We

will have two keynote addresses. After that we'll have a quick address by civic data lab on one of our initiative called civic data space. Then we will have the first panel which will be on

demystifying data and AI collaboratives followed by a quick Q&amp;A. The second panel will be on applying data and AI collaboratives for economic growth and social good. Again followed by a Q&amp;A. We

will only be possible to take two questions from the audience. So I would request anyone who is asking the questions to be more pointed and precised and also be clear to whom

you're asking the question as well. So without any delay we can begin. I would first like to welcome our first keynote address speaker ambassador Harry Fur. Ambassador Fur serves as the ambassador

at large since September 2025. He was also appointed as a special envoy on AI for the Netherlands. He's a seasoned Dutch diplomat with over 40 years of service for the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs of the Kingdom of Netherlands. Ambassador, I would request you to please join us for the keynote. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your introduction. I I always get frightened when I hear

service of 40 years. That is a little bit over the top, but it's true, I'm afraid. I hope you all had your morning coffee. It's uh it's going to be intense this

morning. Um thank you very much and um it's a real pleasure uh to open today's conversation on strengthening data and AI collaboratives for economic growth and social good. We are at a decisive

moment. The way we govern, share, and use data and AI today will shape our economic prosperity and social well-being for decades to come. The key question is not whether data

data and AI will transform our world. They already are. The real question is will we shape this transformation together or will we or will fragmentation,

mistrust and missed opportunities define our future. So people say that as the Dutch we're direct. So let me be direct and honor that stereotype. Collaboration doesn't

happen automatically. It happens when incentives are aligned, when governance is clear, and when participants trust the system. Trust is the foundation of data sharing.

Organization hesitate to share data if they fear risks to privacy, security or competitive advantage. This is why governance frameworks matter.

Instruments like the EU's data act and data governance act aren't bureaucratic exercises. They are trustbuilding tools. They create clear rules, introduce trusted

intermediaries, and provide legal certainty. This makes sharing data not only possible but attractive. But trust alone isn't enough. The European Data Union strategy recognizes

that stakeholders participate when they see tangible benefits, new business models, improved public services, environmental impact, and inclusive growth. This is enlightened

self-interest at its best. In the Netherlands, we try to put this philosophy into practice through our national technology strategy. We invest in strong public

private partnerships. Government companies, research institutions, and civil societies work together to build data and an AI ecosystem that serves society as a whole.

For example, the center of excellence for data sharing and cloud and the AI coalition for the Netherlands bring together diverse actors not to compete but to co-create.

I'll give you another concrete example. GPTNL, a Dutch large language model. GTPNL does not rely on web scrape data of unclear origin. It works with contractual agreements.

Data holders such as public institutions, archives, libraries, media organizations, they agree to share data under clear terms and in return they receive a revenue stake and

importantly they retain control over how their data is used. This model respects intellectual property, democratic values and transparency and it shows that

innovation and responsibility can go hand in hand. This is what the 21st century collaborations look like to our mind. Mutual benefit, shared governance and

respect for autonomy. So we invest not only financial resources but also in infrastructure and people through initiatives such as Euro HPC and

our upcoming AI factory. We lower barriers to access high performance computing and this enables small and medium enterprises, researchers and startups to participate in advanced AI

development. Access must not be limited to the few. Innovation must be inclusive. Equally important is human capital. We're expanding data science and AI

education, investing in reskilling and promoting data literacy and ethical AI across sectors. Technology without skilled people is simply hardware. Real impact comes from

people who understand both the opportunities and the responsibilities. And finally, we must think about scale. Pilot projects are important, but they must grow beyond experimentation.

Long-term funding depends on measurable results, and that means focusing on collaboratives on real societal challenges, healthcare, climate resilience, food security, and

education. So, let me end by saying that none of this works without interoper interoperability. International standards for data

quality, metadata and technical compatibility are not constraints. They are enablers. Data that cannot connect cannot create value. We must

leverage the synergy between data and AI. Open and well-governed data can train AI models to tackle societal challenges and AI tools can make data more accessible and useful especially

for non-experts. So together they create a virtuous cycle of innovation and impact. The panel discussion today will explore these themes in greater detail. You will

hear practical experiences, challenges and lessons learned. And as you listen, I encourage you to reflect on three questions. One, what can my organization contribute? Two, what value do we want

to create? And three, how can we move from isolated efforts to shared ecosystems? So data and AI collaborative succeed when we move from zero sum thinking to

positive sum outcomes when we understand the shared pro shared prosperity requires shared commitment. So thank you and I look forward to a productive and inspiring conversation. Thank you very

much. Thank you ambassador for sharing your insights and setting the stage right in the place. Next I would like to welcome our next keynote speaker Frederick

Warner based in Geneva Switzerland. Frederick Bunner is a recognized leader at the intersection of artificial intelligence, technology and global development as the chief of strategic

engagement at ITU, the United Nations specialized agency for digital technologies and the chief of strategy and operations for AI for good. Frederick drives and drives initiatives

that shapes the future of AI roles in solving humanity's greatest challenges. I would request Frederick to kindly come and deliver your &gt;&gt; Thank you for that kind introduction.

Let me begin with a question. What if the last thing us humans ever invention itself? Now what do what do I mean by that? So I

was speaking with cy cyber security AI expert Roman Yampolski in New York a few weeks ago and he said Fred what is AI for good? Is it for good or for good? I was like hm that's a good question. What

what do you mean there? And he said well for good you know meaning beneficial positive good or for good as in forever? I said hm that's actually a very good question. And then he said, 'What if AI

is the last thing that us humans ever invent? And you might agree or disagree with that statement, but I think it's not hard to imagine that future inventions

might be invented by AI or with collaboration of AI in one way or another. And if that's the case, we better make sure that if AI is for good, it's actually for good. Now, AI for good

was created by ITU in 2017. And if you think about it, that's an eternity in terms of AI years because AI is moving so fast. And we've really seen AI evolve from the fear and promise and hype of AI

mainly existing in fancy marketing slides to traditional machine learning for prediction engines. Uh we saw generative AI arriving at around 2023. Uh yes, last year the theme of AI for

good summit unofficially was the rise of the AI agents. And I think we're now entering a zeroclick world where AIs are not waiting for our prompts, but they're actually acting on our behalf. And on

top of this, we're seeing the physical manifestation of AI in the form of robotics, embodied AI, bring computer interfaces, space AI, and even quantum computing. So what is AI for good? Well,

simply for good, simply put, it's to unlock AI's potential to serve humanity. And how do we do this? Well, first of all, we can't do this alone. No, nobody can. No country, no organization, no

company. So that's why we have virtually the entire UN system, 50 plus UN sister agencies as partners of AI for good. But also the AI experts themselves would say AI is too important to leave to the

experts themselves. So great efforts have been made to bring as many different diverse voices to the table from industry to member states to NOS's to academics to media to young people

and everyone in between. So, what does AI for good look like? I actually want to highlight a case that came through our innovation factory, which is a year-long AI startup pitching

competition. And we had a startup from Estonia that can actually detect the amount of sugar that's in your blood just by the sound of your voice using AI on a phone. Now, why is that important?

I mean, that could be a game changer for diabetes, right? Uh diabetes, it's a global killer. Taking your blood sugar monitoring, it's very inconvenient. It's painful. It's expensive. So, this could

really, it's a pilot right now, but it could really be a game changer. But at the same time, if AI can tell how much sugar is in your blood, what else can it tell about you? What were you doing last

night? Are you tired? Did you have too much wine? Are you paying attention? Are you paying attention? Are you lying? So, it's not hard to imagine how it can also be used

and abused. So, it's not always about what AI could do, but what AI should do. And when we see AI for good, we see many high potential applications. Uh anything from affordable health care to education

for all to food security to clean energy uh and disaster response and and everything in between. But how do we know these high potential AI applications work equally well on men or

women, on children or the elderly, on persons with different skin colors, persons with disabilities, or in low resource settings where things we take for granted like electricity, 5G, access

to cloud, data applications, um these are actually real concerns. So you can't assume that these are natural reflexes for the fastmoving tech and startup industry. I think the track record so

far has been we build it and we'll fix it afterwards. But these are things that we think deeply about at AI for good with all of our partners. So basically how can you take these highle

applications and make sure they scale globally? Well in Davos a few weeks ago we launched a flagship report with the United Nations University and it looked at some AI for good use cases in three

different areas. One is uh geo AI. So how we can use uh basically satellite imagery to take the pulse of a planet and help to predict climate weather uh disaster response and everything. And

also we looked at uh robotics and use cases for accessibility and uh and healthcare and also we looked at telecommunications of course and we identified five pathways on how we can

scale AI for good globally. Uh first is access to good data, sovereign data and how we can share data in a way that's safe but also responsible and usable. Uh the second is infrastructure and

connectivity. Uh of course ITU's mission is to connect the world but a third of the world still remains unconnected. So bridging that gap is very important. The third is skills. uh when we had our AI

glo global dialogue last year we had over 100 ministers from 100 countries and they all basically identified addressing the AI skills gap as a top prior priority doesn't matter if you're

a developing country or a developed country uh third fourth rather is uh governance and standards and if you look at these fast emerging governance frameworks around the world I like to

think of it as a a moving target and it's not a one-sizefits-all approach but how can you turn turn these ambitious just words and text from principles into implementation. And standards is one of

those tools because as you develop standards, you can make sure that you bake in security, safety, human rights, sustainability, and basically make sure that they're inclusive for all. And when

businesses start to use AI across borders, whether it's through services and products, then you can have that common sense thinking built into standards, which is one of the ways of

implementing these many governance frameworks around the world. And then the last of course is creating an AI ecosystem where you have the speed of startups, the scale of governments, but

also the basically the academic rigor of academia. So I think these are all of the pieces of the puzzle that need to be addressed if you want to move beyond pilots into scale and when you're

looking at the global south I think one thing that's encouraging about India is I don't think you need to be the best in AI or have the best model or the largest model but you can be the best when it

comes to diffusion and adoption and I think India has a very good track record of this when you're looking at digital public in infrastructure uh digital ID financial inclusion dig digital

payments. There's a very good track record at diffusing technology at scale with a very large population and I'm optimistic that the same thing could be done with AI and that it could even

serve as a kind of playbook for the global south and the rest of the world. So with that I'd like to thank you for your attention and hope uh you can all join us at the AI for good global summit

in Geneva on the 7th to the 10th of July. Thank you. Thank you so much Frederick. Those were really really insightful thoughts that you had presented.

After our thoughts from our keynote speakers, we would like to give you a quick glimpse of you know how civic data lab has been envisaging the data and AI collaboratives. For that I would like to

call forward the CEO and co-founder of Civic Data Lab, Gorov Gudwani. Gorov, over to you. A very good morning all of you. It's so hard to follow now uh ambassador Harry

uh Wervage and Fred Werner's keynote inputs. I think they have set really the ground for what we are going to unbundle on data and AI collaborative. So quickly seeing what it may look like in

practice. Uh just raise your hand if you have made three new connections in last two days. Good job folks. Good job. Now how do we sustain these connections on building

and co-creating data standards, identifying AI use cases, identifying ways to make these models work in practice and that's what data AI data and AI collaboratives are truly about.

So we have created civic data space our platform to host data and AI collaboratives at one place. It has components of data exchange. It has the data standards most at the metadata

level as well as sectoral nature. It's open source. It's use caseled collaboration. It encourages that it has AI model registry and it also has open data data sets which are freely

available for you to scale uh the work you're doing. uh and some of our early collaboratives to come on board are some of the pressing needs we are facing in the region. First as you know climate

and health is one of the major issue which we are facing in the region Asia Pacific is heating twice as compared to other regions. So how do we get high value data sets related to climate and

health at one place make them interoperable make them standardized. This is our big bat in India, Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand where we have plugged in data sets from the government

agencies, civil society partners, innovators, uh, academic institutions and identifying AI use cases on extreme heat, flood management, air pollution and some of the other pressing needs of

the region and are fostering collaborations between the stakeholders to share knowledge, share information together. Second one is gender. You have been

hearing this across the other sessions as well and you would hear more about it in this session. Gender and inclusion issues are real when it comes to AI model and we really need to get data and

AI work for gender and inclusion and for that to happen we need to bring in data sets which can highlight some of the gender gaps which we are facing in the region. Identify use cases which can

help progress some of the targets we have set for ourselves for gender and inclusion and that's another collaborative we have started here. So we don't want to stop here. We want to

have more collaboratives come on board on our platform. We want to help you out figure out how do we adopt more data standards, find other collaboratives, uh find use cases where all of us can

work together and share more knowledge, more work together. So you can scan this QR code and and register on the platform uh show your interest and we would work to on board you soon. So with that we

would move to our first panel. I would bring my colleague Nupura again to introduce the panel. Thanks a lot, Gorus. Uh we start with the first panel. The first panel focuses

on demystifying data and AI collaborators. This panel is joined by uh joined by five experts. I would like to call them one by one. The first expert I would

like to invite is Aryen Hildebrandt. Arien is the director general of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development Germany. She's responsible for global health,

equality of opportunity, digital technologies, and food security. Our second panelist is Anna Tumo Tumodor, I'm apologies for pronouncing it wrong, is the CEO of Creative Commons. She's

focused on safeguarding equitable open access to knowledge while balancing societal considerations regarding creative labor in an age of AI. Next, we have Alexandro Oprinko.

Alexander is the UNP Asia-Pacific regional innovation adviser and team leader for innovation and digital leading the regional innovation and digital team. Next we have Martin

Tisnney. Martin is the founder and the chair of on the board of for current AI. Martin leads the air collaborative a new philanthropic organization ideated in 2023 to help govern and build artificial

intelligence based on democrative values and principles. We have Nasubu but unfortunately she's stuck in traffic so she might join in sometime. And finally our moderator God

of Godwani. Thanks a lot Nura. So we have a great first panel. We are going to have another one. So it's going to be a lot of musical chair which you're going to

see today. So thanks a lot all the uh esteemed speakers for joining us today. Uh let's unbundle what are data and AI collaboratives and how can they drive economic growth. I would start with

Martin you first you have been working on data collaboratives and AI collaboratives for a while. Help us unbundle this term. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thanks very much for having

me. Um we have a lot of panelists. We don't have very much time. I'm just going to make three quick points. The first point I'd like to make is despite and actually this is why I was

excited to come this morning. Despite the focus of this session and this panel, I think we talk very little about data when we talk about AI. Um, and I've been surprised by that. We're always

talking about compute, about the importance of compute for artificial intelligence. And I think relatively rarely do we talk about data. Partly I think it's

my surprise comes from the fact that we've forgotten Shashana Zubof's caution which is the degree to which user data is the raw material for artificial intelligence. So that's really my first

point is that when we think about data, we need to think about the governance around it, how it's used for AI. And by and large, that's not the conversation I think that we're having globally. And

partly my suspicion is that we've become complacent around it. And we've become too used especially in social media to the attention economy and to the advertising business model and to the

fact that fundamentally user data is the raw material for artificial intelligence. Um if you want to talk to someone who can speak about this much better than I can I would highly

recommend Meredith Whitaker the president of signals work on this. That's my first point. The second one is if and as we're going to focus on data, we need to really unleash a lot more

innovation than we have today. Again, I'm really struck by the innovation we've seen in compute in artificial intelligence over the past 10 years or so. There's been very little innovation

in data. I would love to be proven wrong by the panel, by audience members. um all of the work that I've heard of that I've seen over the past 10 or 15 years, different models of data stewardship, um

systems such as data trusts where communities can come together under a fiduciary to share data in a controlled environment I think are great and I think have actually progressed very

little over the past decade when you look at innovation in computer and other settings and AI and I think that's a huge problem. So from my perspective for the work we're doing at current AI and

the work that I'm doing at AI collaborative we're really pushing we're putting financing and effort towards technical innovation when it comes to data so we can separate personal data

from the model and governance innovation so that we can have different type of data stewardship models to ensure that personal data is actually not only protected but can be used at scale and

this is really what we're pushing for I would I think But I'll go even a little bit further on that second point. I hear a lot of people routinely and I'm sure there'll be many over the course of

these few days who will in some ways I think slightly flippantly say that AI will cure cancer. I don't think AI will cure cancer at all unless we have much better, much more innovative ways of

sharing data, sharing patient treatment outcome data and sharing genetic data. And I don't think we're anywhere close to that right now. I simply think people don't trust rightly so the systems to

share such sensitive data. We can have another conversation in terms of AI and cancer. I think there's loads of progress done around detection but that's because the data is less

sensitive. So that's my second point. And then my third point you were talking about collaboratives and AI broadly. I think it's fantastically important for all of us to focus and to in some ways

to refocus the AI conversation globally towards collaboration and cooperation rather than competition. So in this moment and following the two fantastic keynotes, I think it's it's easy for us

to think that collaboration is the way. It's not. Right now competition geopolitically is what's driving AI. It's competition between the states and China. It's competition between

different countries. I think we really have to make a big effort and to push for that to be collaborative and that was the big part of the AI action summit last year that I helped organize in

Paris. And I'll finish with this last point. When it comes to collaborations and competition, my fear is all the conversation about AI sovereignty gets it all wrong. The sovereignty debate

right now is fundamentally about control and about countries aspiring to control the stack at home, which I think is illusory. Effectively what's needed is collaboration to have a global

open-source AI stack where countries can share the different benefits and at the same time control data that matters. So those are my three points. Thank you for having me.

&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot Martin for setting such a powerful uh landscape in front of us. Core is to solve for data collaborative and specifically data sharing to make this work. Uh now I would quickly go to

Anna. Anna, you have been figuring this out for a while at Creative Commons with amazing licensing uh structure. Now that we are sensing the struggle to share, what what is the way forward? Well, I

think um uh it's actually really encouraging to uh think about the work you're doing with civic data space and ways people can come together to share data sets under conditions that suit

them and for collaboration because uh there are certain data that absolutely should be open is in the public domain. We're thinking you know climate data, weather recordings, you know sea levels

etc etc like these are things that are are public goods and there should be a huge effort made capture that data and uh and make it publicly available so that folks can you

know do research, innovate, help drive towards solutions. But there's other data that is indeed more sensitive beyond the personal data that Martin spoke about, but even when we think

about cultural heritage data for instance and so I wanted to use that as like a grounding example when we think about uh how we could potentially conceive of AI and data collaboratives

that align both sort of incentives with the public interest. So everybody, most people I would imagine in their life have at some point visited a library, been to a museum, maybe even visited

their national archives. There is so much information that we have about our cultures, about our languages, about our shared heritage that exists that is not readily available for us in digital

format to build on and to learn from today. Uh a huge barrier to this is simply funding. It's really expensive to do high quality digitization of assets. And whether we're talking, you know,

physical assets or text or or whatever the case may be, that is one of the number one barriers to sharing of cultural heritage. Another barrier is just people because we don't necessarily

know our way around these things. We don't necessarily have the expertise to not just the sort of mechanics of digitization, but like the actual sharing of the materials. Are they under

copyright? Are they in the public domain? Are there other considerations that we need to take into account? Is this traditional knowledge? Does it need to be labeled accordingly? etc. Um, and

then the the final barrier I would say is is sort of the policy environment. There's no shared international or national instruments that encourage this sort of move towards access to heritage.

Now you can imagine a private sector corporation coming in and saying look it is in our best interests our market incentives to get access to highquality data because therefore we will have a

better model a [clears throat] more representative model it'll be more useful to the people in the in the culture that we are trying to serve etc etc. So that's what they need and what

these institutions need is they need funding, they need technical access, they need support so that they can fulfill their public interest missions of sharing this with the public broadly.

And so you can imagine a collaboration where there is support for that work so that subsequently the rest of us can benefit from it as well. And I would think sort of uh your your platforms

like your civic data spaces, your hugging faces, your misilla data collectives etc. Those are those are great places to think about where you can share these high-quality data sets

ideally with shared metadata standards so that they data can all talk to each other. Um where where you can indicate how you want this data to be used because again some data in the public

interest belongs in the public domain should be open for all of us all of the time and I I think we have some interesting um sort of climate climate and science panelists uh coming up. But

as for some of these other more sensitive materials, I think we really need to think innovatively about how we can still get that into the hands of the people to benefit from it.

&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot Anna for sharing those remarks and and thanks a lot for laying the way forward how I how we can you know unlock data sharing for critical uh scenarios like that. Aran quickly coming

to you um how is BMZ seeing this as an opportunity for economic cooperation and development? how critical data and AI collaborations are for economic opportunities.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Very much important. Of course, so much has been said already in the la in the first few minutes in the keynotes and the contributions. So, let me say we do have to think about

ecosystems for data sharing rather than uh short projects in development corporation. Of course, there's a lot of short projects, but this is about ecosystems. Access to data, raw

material, as you have heard, is still extremely concentrated. Only 33 countries worldwide have the computing power that is needed to um to um um to cloud AI in their own territories

and more than 150 countries do not have a single data center. And therefore of course for the global south this is one of the main challenges the the access uh long-term ecosystems are not created

overnight and not created by one actor alone. Therefore it requires governments and the private sector civil society international partners to work together with a shared vision and a joint road

map. So development cooperation of course is always about international cooperation. From our experience in the BMZ German Ministry for economic cooperation and

development, I see three building blocks. Um the first one is um opensource AI should be the foundation for trust and scale. It allows innovators to build AI solutions without

milliondoll compute budgets or enormous resource usage and this is essential for inclusive sustainable growth and local innovation. One important activity that we as BMZ

are supporting is the creation of voice technology for everyone with open data and models here in India. We have partnered with the Indian Institute of Science and the government initiative

Bashini to create digital public goods for language AI. Second is build shared assets not isolated solutions. For example, through our fair forward initiative, we have

shared 55 open data sets as digital public goods and released 16 open AI building blocks. And then third, choose cooperation over competition. As Martin Tisel just said too often, AI is framed

as something like a global arms race, but competition leads to concentration, secrecy, and exclusion. Um, therefore, this is also why we as BMZ are shaping the global discourse on

responsible AI. Together with UNDP last year we launched the Hamburg declaration de declaration on responsible IIA for the SDGs and it now has been endorsed by more than 50 partners across sectors. It

provides a shared reference point for fair and inclusive AI development. And so my key message would be if you want AI to drive economic growth and social goods, we must invest in openness,

shared ownership and in people. And we need to treat AI as a global public good, not as a zero someum game. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks a lot, Arian. And uh we were part

of the Hamburg uh declaration for AI. So uh we really appreciate the effort there. Uh quickly coming to Alex, how do we solve for scaling? Skilling remains one of the major issue when we talk

about AI and data collaboratives. How UNDP is tackling that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks so much Garf. I think I I would like to take a slightly different angle and um I think our role is mostly

not to focus on data generation standards but more focus on the way how we bridge that to decision- making. uh because scaling will not happen if data is not going to decision- making. We are

making very clear distinction between data and intelligence. Uh the intelligence is something that uh gets into the decision- making. So the and um this is very important because if the

decision makers are not using data not deploying then the things are not going to change right. So through our work what we are trying to do, what we are trying to focus on is how we expand

using the data and intelligence the policy choices that the decision makers in the government have. So just to give you a few examples, it can happen at the individual level. We are talking about

uh uh economic growth. So there are quite a few examples now around where AI and data help uh at the individual level, micro level to improve economic productivity. Uh few years ago we

started working together with uh our country office here and developed DRA platform that uses open satellite is an open platform that uses satellites data imagery machine learning to improve

indivi individual decision decisions by farmers on climate resilient crops and so forth. Right? But take it to a different level. If you can take data to the way how it changes the way

institutions sake make decisions. Fast forward, Indonesia, the uh recently elected president has nine programs uh all of which multi-billion dollars landing at the village level and are

supposed to uh deal with several important issues. Free mills, improved farming and so forth. So each of those and I'm going to the collaboration point. Each of those is implemented by a

different ministry. Those ministries as we know in the government in many public sector institutions don't talk to each other. Each of the ministries implements

multi-billion dollar programs. the data that is we can use first of all use AI to understand where the gaps where the opportunities for coherence where the leakages are and then deal with that

through data exchange in the government DPIs allows us to on the one side to avoid that leakage to improve efficiency but importantly and I'm going back to the point around the choice it creates

additional fiscal space for the government because those resources can be reallocated to other needs to other policy priorities that the government have. Um, another critical example where

the data important from the collaboration standpoint is with the eye and uh, machine learning. We now can get much more inputs from citizens and users into decision- making. uh again in

several countries we are deploying platform called thrive that allows to people to contribute the inputs and provide feedback on the policy planning at the village level. So I think that's

uh another way in which data has a very empowering role. We are shifting the balance in the policy conversation at the local level. uh so from that perspective this bridge that is required

to link data to decision-m to the creation of choices is very important the last bit cor uh before I hand over uh what is really important for us is that data is linked to the policy intent

of the government uh everyone heard examples of satellite data used for map out waste flows how we can improve uh the waterways in the cities and all that what is really important is whether this

information This shift in patterns how we manage waste can actually contribute to a much bigger transformation which is for instance circle economy a green transition at the city level. We have an

big EU funded uh jab program across Philippines with 20 cities that use data uh machine learning to improve the waste management. But that that creates resources for them to fund upmarket

upstream market uh uh enterprises and thememes for the uh for the circular economy transition. uh the same once uh decision makers see this type of a data, this type of intent, they understand how

the resources can be relocated and this is so hugely important in many countries now where the fiscal space is so tight is that you often don't need to bring additional resources, additional

investment or loans from elsewhere. You actually have that public resource. It just needs a particular direction. So this again an example where we use data to direct the money through green public

procurement to subsidy programs for the government to drive a particular policy intent. &gt;&gt; Brilliant. Thanks for sharing that wonderful example. Quickly going to

Nasubu. Nasubu we are running a bit short on time. Maybe in just 2 minutes explain how Kala is trying to empower uh collaborations on data and AI in Africa. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh thank you for this opportunity.

Um so KALA is a digital innovation lab. Our work it cuts across research uh building products. So I come with a lens of what it actually means to build [clears throat] AI tools and AI models

in Africa. So the one thing that we realize it's two to three times more expensive than other languages and we did a study across uh 15 low resource languages in Africa

and because of that it means that we have to also look at data from an economic value looking at it from the point of view that it's obviously two two to three times more expensive but

then how then can we also um feeding into what Anna um mentioned about the historical data, how do we then um take that data and ensure that it's it's well representative for the people in our

market. So talking about the economic uh value of data and what that means in in building um digital tools and digital platforms for Africa. So that has to be a discussion that we need to look look

at look at also how are we um excluded and how does um how can we um ensure that we are well represented for example if you look at let's say even in data labeling um for African um people of

African descent they may decide to take a pseudonyame of someone in the western or even um in India um populations because that is very well accepted but for us we have to take a pseudonym. So

how do how do we how are we representing ourselves how do we ensure that even as we are thinking about um AI and data collaboratives we ensure that all voices are well represented and we ensure that

each and every scenario is you know put into put into action. So as Kala we are bringing the um disadvantages or the things that um um I say times up um we are bringing their disadvantages into

play so that we ensure that each person um has a voice um and we are able to represent them equally. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Nasub for sharing that powerful message that we have to ensure

everyone finds a representation then only these data and AI collaboratives would work. Now we would quickly shift to the next panel. Big round of applause for this panel

inputs with us. We move to the next panel. The next panel looks at applying data and AI collaborators for economic growth and social good. I would like to invite all the panelists on stage. First

we have Dr. Agnes Kiraaga. Agnes Garaga leads the data science program at the African Population Health Research Council in Nairobi, Kenya. Next, we have Dr. Cecilia Celestei. Cecilia Celesti is

the professor, adviser, and speaker on artificial intelligence, gender, and rights. She's also the co-chair of the AI credentials group of the women for ethical AI platform, UNESCO. Next, we

have Miss Christine Arab. Christine Arab has dedicated over 25 years to advancing gender gender equality and women's human right within the UN system. Next we have Dr. Kathleen Victor. Kathleen is

currently the scientific cooperation officer at the pasture network. Then we have Eur Kim. Dr. Kim has served as the chief of the hydraological and water resources division of the world

mrological organization since 2019. And we have finally the moderator Mercedes forgrass who leads the innovation and digit digitalization workstream at the partnership in

statistics for development in the 21st century which is Paradis 21. Over to you Mercedes. There we go. Thank you so much Napora. It's a pleasure to be here. I am very

aware of time uh and I know that I can speak fast so I will try to speak uh audibly and uh and and eloquently as well. Um, but I think the the previous panel we had just now was really good at

setting the scene, but I'd like to take the time now to really dive in and think about the applications. We've got a full women panel here, uh, who are full experts, much more experts than I am in

some really interesting subject matter domains. So, I'd like to start with you, Kathleen. Um, coming from the climate health data nexus and really looking at that type of data and AI collaboratives,

what does success look like? What is an effective version of this type of policy collaborative? Okay. So, uh we work on climate and health and we we look at how uh climate

and climate change and en environmental change uh can impact cl uh health. We do that in 18 different countries in the world and mostly in low and middle inome countries. So, I'll take it a little bit

on from the academic side. Um and so what we see we uh collect data at the quantitative and qualitative uh level. I would like to go back to uh the the person who was sitting here and who was

saying that data is the real important uh issue because if you have wrong data and you put it in a good model you get wrong answers anyway. So um for us the difficulty uh is to get good data. uh we

have very dispersed data on health and on climate um even within uh our community it is difficult to exchange and to have health data. So what we try to do is uh to create uh a community

where data and a good standardized data is uh can be exchanged. The first question is then what is standardized data? uh even within the academic sector there is a big discussion on that and I

think that's one of the first things that has to be uh addressed as well and what is a good governance on that um so that is I suppose creating a good data sharer sharing ecosystem that's the

first thing and define what is good data um we uh the qualitative data we do it with uh the persons on the ground they go and ask uh what does heat means for uh communities

uh and then they see if that heat is related to a risk and if they included that risk in their model. Um so the communities they won't return uh working with communities is also understand what

is going on and and give their feedback on what you're doing. Um so frugal science is one of the answers we found in that and include the community as much as possible and that brings me back

to and then I'll start [laughter] to um the our other stakeholders which are ministries ministries we uh are making our models for ministries and we should not forget that they should

understand that and they should be able to use them. Um so put knowledge breakers into the ministries is one of the responses we got into into that direction. Uh and I'll stop there.

[laughter] Thank you. Thank you very much. Now moving over to Huin. Um from your perspective, I know you have quite a lot of interesting experience working

especially in the this the the area of science and weather and meteorological um spaces. But from your perspective, how can these AI and data collaboratives better integrate the cross- sectoral

intelligence from from climate, from water and also from health? &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for your question. First of all, um I want to advocate a little bit about WMO. I hope everybody

knows about my organization, World Mological Organization, which is UN specialized agency for weather, climate, and water. Some people think because of our name world micical organization they

thought we only supporting for the weather and climate or mage. No that's not true. We work for the water hydraological services especially focus on flood and drought. As you may know

now and even every single years we faced with flood and drought damage and issue. People are dying, kids are dying. We received uh just a month ago I was in Sagard Dakar to attend the high

preparatory meeting for UN water conference 2026. I heard messages from Africa colleagues especially kids are dying because they didn't get the information accurate information in

advance. There was no such information tailored information to community and to the people last my approach even though the high technique like AI is emerging that

we see that here that we talking about AI whole this week but it doesn't sometimes go to the people that's the critical point and WMO our organization work for that so as Gurav mentioned

about standardization and also interoperability often for everyone. That's very critical. Some technology only having dominated by certain countries or

certain developed companies. It should be shared with everyone. We are saving people's lives and that is very critical that what we work and in WMO we have a pilot study already

working in the four countries that how AI can improve blood forecasting result and also we very much closely working with all our partners how we can make use of those result to reach out to the

people and I hope we have more opportunity to to I know that we have very limited time so please let us know If you have we need additional information I'm happy to provide and we

closely working to all the partners in the world not only among the UN organization but private academic public and all the uh stakeholders we closely working trying to save the lives and

minimize damage from what extreme event. Thank you. Thank you very much Wein. Uh very useful here. And now I want to move over to you Christine. Talk to us from the the embedding at the the design

process of data and AI collaboratives from the gender and inclusion perspective. Um as the previous panel indicated AI is only as powerful in many ways as

the data that's fed into it. Um and we have a choice right at this stage is if we base it on the existing data that largely is an effect we'll be replicating centuries of inequality

based on gender based on location age uh what type of group you represent. So it has to be intentional because it does make a difference. It will make a significant difference if we

intentionally look at data from the perspective of the eyes of women and girls and what that data and the algorithms that are based around it uh feed. We have UN women has a AI school

just in Asia Pacific. Um and it's been working with women and girls and actually the UN system on helping uh to govern, design and responsibly roll out AI from a gender perspective. And what

we've learned from that are there's three key aspects that have to be considered from if you want to have a gender responsive AI approach. And that is investing, partnership and scale. Now

when we look at investing that is about not only making sure that women are part of the design process and have a leadership but you have to invest in the data and the source of data and you have

to invest in the policies that policies all of that requires women's leadership and this is where we're at a disadvantage. Yeah. The second is the south south cooperation. So,

oh okay there's no time. Yeah, this is interesting. Okay, so the partnership please south south cooperation please remember local languages unless you want to compound the discrimination not just

based on gender but also location and socioeconomic background. Um and you need to have women's voice embedded in the middle of it. And then you have to build accountability into the

infrastructure as you scale it. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Those are all great points and I do hope that we can take more time after this panel. I know we have two speakers left and I want to make sure we

do give space for you both to really chime in here. Uh but Cecilia, I know that you also work a lot on the the gender and social bias aspect of things here. Um can you tell us a little bit

more about how do we how do we really ensure that ethical safeguards are actually taken into account to make sure that we safeguard those groups? &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for for your question

and thank you so much for having me. It's a pleasure to be here. Well, first of all, we have to think in in not that just sharing data. We have to think of of the idea of ethic governance of the

AI. So, can how can we share data in an inclusive way? This is not for me. I hope so. Five minutes. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Five minutes more. Okay. Thank you. So, uh what can we work with

the idea of the ethic governance of the AI while we are sharing this data? First of all, we have to address like three main questions in order to trying to find this umbrella of the governance of

the AI. How, what and who, how are going to share the data? What kind of data we are going to share and who and who is going to be benefit from this sharing? How we have to warranty some safe words

in order to ensure that everyone is included. So privacy first of all privacy concerns and privacy principles. Secondly um sec cyber security measures and finally accountability.

Second question what what kind of data we are going to share and we are going to focus on a inclusion and representation of the data sets and AI extractivism that we are going to try to

avoid. And finally the third the third point is related to who who is going to benefit. So we have to focus in the social communities and as Christine was mentioned before thinking into about the

marginalized communities under represented groups that has to be part. So sharing data is easy but doing it ethically is the real challenge. Thank &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And now Agnes I want you to

bring us home because I know you work much more on on all of these things. You work on population data. From your perspective, how can we really move forward?

&gt;&gt; Yes. Um, uh, thank you for saving the best for the last. And I, I I I represent, um, [laughter] uh, uh, I think two collaboratives. One that is focused on data, which is a

countdown 2030. You can check it out on the internet. 23 years of using data for population based research. Uh, 85 countries. And this data is really helping tracking maternal mortality in

many of these African countries. The second is an AI collaborative which is called the data science without borders project also running at the African population and health research center.

What we've learned uh about 23 years of working in population based research in Africa. Relationship infrastructure is what is important. If you can't build relationships that allow data sharing to

work closely, it's going to be impossible to have data successful data collaboratives. Second is complimentarity. Many times as researchers, AI

developers, we come in with our own interests. A researcher wants publication. An AI tool developer wants IP on their tools. The community wants a solution. How do we put all this

together to have uh collaboratives that speak to the last mile? Like um uh like uh Kim has said last mile impact in all these collaborative is going to be very important. We've heard about skilling

definitely data centers are lacking in Africa but um I think there are more nuances to sharing data that we need to look at that are more social than technical and most of these are really

going to drive ethical data sharing and the successful uh data collaboratives. I think there's a lot of a lot of things to say, but in the interest of time, I'll stop there and just to say it was a

great panel and we look forward to having another one that allows us to talk more. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I agree. I think this is really the first part of this discussion. There's

so much more to be said. I think you finished us off really well there though, really focusing on this this community aspect and making sure that everybody is at the table and uh and the

sharing that is very important. So, um please join me in in applauding our speakers here today. I know we are at time. Uh I'll let Nupura finish us off. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; That's beginning soon. So we would connect with all the panelists outside the room. So once again, thank you so much for joining us for this insightful discussion. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I kind of
