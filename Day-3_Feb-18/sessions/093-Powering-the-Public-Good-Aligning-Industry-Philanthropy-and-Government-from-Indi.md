## 📝 Transcript

two-part conversation teed up for you today. And to start, I have the pleasure of introducing two distinguished leaders who are at the forefront of technology and emerging markets. And judging by the

the crowd here, I think they need no elaborate introduction. We have Nanda Nilinkani who's the founder chairman of Infosys. He's [applause] the chairman of ASEP

Foundation and a visionary behind India's digital transformation. We also have Sang Buu Kim who oversees the digital vice presidency for the World Bank and who's building a robust

portfolio of investment and advisory services to help with digital transformation all around the world. So, Sang Buu and Nand thanks for being here. Please join me on stage.

Oh, yeah. All right. Group photo. &gt;&gt; Okay. [laughter] &gt;&gt; All right. So, to kick us off, I want to start with Nandan. You've inspired such an entirely new way of thinking about

how open digital rails can be the backbone of kind of a competing competitive thriving marketplace where solutions providers are competing to serve even the most hardto-reach people

with services that are indispensable to the modern economy. And I feel like you can see it every day here in India where the payments infrastructure has brought so many people into the financial

sector. You've seen how identity services is bringing people into government services that they were excluded from and it's created this kind of Cambrian explosion of innovation here

and I wonder if you can see the same trajectory in AI. I mean, can you imagine steering AI so that you don't have the concentration of market power and instead see more of a competitive

landscape that leads to adoption and inclusion? &gt;&gt; No, I think uh many of the lessons we learned from creating a population scale digital public infrastructure

will apply to AI. I think what what really happened was we created a body of knowledge which allowed things to go from an idea to a billion scale whether it was Aadhaar UPI whatever so I think

and that's not just technology technology just one part of it it's really about how do you harness institutions how do you do public policy how do you build infrastructure which is

interoperable and scalable how do you create markets to function on top of that there are number of lessons So I think uh and those lessons now are being taken global you know along with

the world bank we have the whole ID you know the whole ID40 is not the world bank but the whole DPI 50 in five 50 countries in five years and so on so that so I think now we need to see how

do we take the lessons from and apply it to the world of AI because the world of AI is different in a number of ways number one the the world of DPI didn't have data in it

&gt;&gt; the world of AI is all about data, public data, private data and so on. It's also non-deterministic you know in I in in in in technology you just in if you say a a plus b equal to c that's the

answer every time in AI it's not so how do you deal with this nondeterminist thing and then how do you also the therefore because it's data and nondeterministic how do you make sure

that it doesn't misbehave the AI therefore what are the guard rails you have what you know for responsible AI so a number of differences but I think there many lessons to be learned and

what we are thinking of is the notion that just like we had the 50 in five approach which sort of sort of brought everybody's minds together sort of focus them we're talking about 100 pathways by

2030 100 pathways to AI deployment which I'll explain later is to have a sort of a time bound program work with partners &gt;&gt; KPI &gt;&gt; yeah and then you're going to actually

make it happen &gt;&gt; so just to press a little bit Um more so in terms of the uh public infrastructure around AI that you would like to see you you mentioned

data but how about the other components &gt;&gt; as in uh &gt;&gt; as in what are the what the parallel to the digital rails &gt;&gt; no I think I think there are number of

learnings uh h how to organize data to be most effective because in many cases data has to be unlocked from wherever it is &gt;&gt; uh how do we have a set of guard

which apply to all public system because you need to be trustable. &gt;&gt; Uh you need to have institutions in charge uh institutions must be willing to back the answers that the AI gives a

number of things that you have to do. So those are actually common to whatever you choose &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and uh then how do you uh design for

frugal usage because I think you know we can't afford the costs of inference that uh these guys have. So how do you build lowc cost solutions? uh how do you what is the role of a LLM

&gt;&gt; you know it's it's not only the thing is people think it's all about LLM is just one piece of the puzzle you may have multiple models you may have some large models some small models all kinds of

things so you have to configure all that in the context of uh once you start by saying what's my destination I want to solve a problem in education or health or agri then you work backwards from

that rather than saying oh I have this great tech and let's make it work &gt;&gt; right right and I suppose And leads me to Sanbu, a question for you. So if none's really outlining some of the

institutional and the data requirements for greater inclusion and adoption. I wonder what else is on your mind in terms of not just addressing the exclusion risk but other risks and

especially for lowincome populations who have so much to gain but also so much to lose in terms of depending on AI generated guidance. Actually I can name so many risks and concerns in

AI era. So as Nandan said that data data protections and cyber security by AI you know you know enabled you know attacking tool and so so many uh you know hallucinations and you know and

copyright issues and so many things but let's set aside those type of the general the risks one of the big risk is for human being uh especially for I would say jobs as well. So if you think

about the the our young generation who is you know growing in in this developing world in South Asia and Africa 1.2 billion people youth will come into

the job market within uh 10 or 15 years and then in our forecast only 400 million jobs will be ready. Still we see 8 100 million jobs gap in next decades but on top of that everybody is also

talking about some jobs displacement by AI. So it can amplify the risks and threats for the job market for the especially for young generation. But the point is that I'm not very

pessimistic about this. I have more positive view for the job creation along with the AI technology in some sense especially for developing world a little different uh you know economic

environment uh developing world have because the AI's intervention and AI technology can be more relevant to the very high-end service job uh which uh lacks

in many developing world. So in another you know hand uh you know maybe it can be a big big opportunity for them to get benefit uh from the AI technology. So in our data for example

15 to 17% of current jobs in developing world can be fully complemented by generative AI compared to only five to 7% of existing jobs in developing world will be at risk

because of the automations. So we see some more job can be supported, complemented, created with AI. So but only if we can properly provide some reskilling

uh in reskilling uh opportunity and program for our young generation that will be the one uh the big uh important issue to minimize the risk. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So Nandan, do you want to add

anything around the issue of trust and fidelity and how do you make sure that these solutions especially the ones that are really you know facing the marginalized communities what what seeds

to sew what what healthcare to seek how do you make sure that &gt;&gt; the guidance really is serving them? No, I think uh uh a lot of it has to do with the data sources that you have

&gt;&gt; like if you see an example uh what we are doing in agriculture &gt;&gt; uh there's a program in Maharashtra which has very successful with millions of farmers all the data is curated it's

data which comes from uh you know authentic sources and they're not necessarily going through an LLM so if you want the market data you get it from the market you want weather data you get

from the weather guys. If you want warehouse capacity data, you get from the warehouse system. So, and then you use the AI to craft the inference of a particular

question, but it gets the data from different places, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And that data is verified and vetted, &gt;&gt; right? So that that puts the sort of the

trust that this data is &gt;&gt; I think I think the mis the it would be a difficult if you just randomly send questions to some uh you know large language model and you can't predict how

it'll reply. So you have to put in guardrails in the design of this itself which we are learning how to do that. So that's when I talked about these pathways. The idea was that once we have

all these learnings, &gt;&gt; we packaged these learnings saying this is how we can build from you know uh idea to impact and then say let's repeat these pathways in different countries

and in different uh areas. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. So I know uh we're splitting up this session into two. We've got some African officials, policy makers coming up on stage soon and I

wonder what advice each of you would have for them like a concrete suggestion for what you would ask of them maybe between now and the next time we meet at the next global AI summit. San do you

want to start? So one observation I have these days regarding uh AI uh development AI initiative by developing countries. So many people and governments are

really careing supply side issues. the pre- requirement for data center, computing power, internet access, energy that is very important. Uh I agree with

that. But on the other you know in another sense more important thing is that how we can create the demand for AI in developing world. what concrete solutions what concrete daily you know

issues we can tackle &gt;&gt; through the concrete solution enabled by AI is a really critical one. So as Nandan said we are seeing a lot of good opportunity and good example and pilot

uh for agriculture for farmers and you know you know patients and you know teachers and so many applications but once we find a really uh good solutions uh enabled by AI

the next step is the replications how can we develop the better uh replicable model across the country. So in this sense I would like to underscore the importance of government expenditure.

So it's typically in developing world uh you know private sectors are really struggling with lack of uh demand from the public side. So I believe public side demand and government expenditure

to develop this AI solution will be the very critical part for the next year. Yeah, very much like the DPI story in in India have a killer use case to start. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; What would you suggest? &gt;&gt; No, I I think uh I think uh that's why I said I think we all need to work together on this because uh uh we have to pull all our knowledge, our insights,

our experiences and in a structured way so that we can quickly share and learn from that. And our idea of this &gt;&gt; 100 pathways is there from all over the world,

&gt;&gt; right? But it's a mutual learning thing. So if you do something in some other country, you can do it in you know. So to give an example, you know, we did this Mahavistar in Maharashtra

&gt;&gt; and uh on February 3rd, it was launched in Ethopia. &gt;&gt; Oh. So the same learnings on what we learned &gt;&gt; Ethiopia implemented much faster because

we there was a template there was a pathway and then uh we did the launch of uh uh of Amul Amul is India's biggest cooperative &gt;&gt; and you know that idea

&gt;&gt; was conceived just a month back &gt;&gt; and and they have excellent systems and data but they didn't know the AI side of it &gt;&gt; so the learnings we had from Agri we put

to livestock and they rolled it out on February 11th. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; They la and they're showing it here. &gt;&gt; So and then yesterday they launched the

national vistar bat vistar. So what we're learning is that if you have these playbooks and if you have these pathways and if you know what what mistakes not to do,

&gt;&gt; you can actually now do this pretty fast. So now we'll learn something else something in Kenya or Ethiopia or uh you know South Africa or Zanek Seneagal or wherever and we'll bring that. So I

think key thing is we cannot run on that supply oriented mindset. It's &gt;&gt; it's not about more chips and more power and more this and more that. I mean

that's not going to solve anybody's problem. We have to actually take problems of people &gt;&gt; How do they get access to livelihoods? How do they get access to health? How do

they get access to education? How do the farmer get access to markets or get access to better information? We solve these kind of things and I think once we have a playbook for solving these kind

of things then it'll spread everywhere and the bank will do a phenomenal job of convening using the con global convening power &gt;&gt; to spread the message on all these

things. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sangu, you're in a perfect position to help be that connective tissue so that there's that repeated and structured learning so that there's uh

kind of nobody's uh has to learn the same mistake twice. Right. Well, thank you both as such timely suggestions since I'm about to hand the microphone over to my colleague Diana

Sang. But before I do so, please uh join me in saying thank you to Sanb Buu and to Nandin for your wisdom here. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; for your leadership over

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Priya. Thank you, Priya. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, Priya. Um, Nandan and Sang Buu. I think that was a really inspirational kickoff and you've set us

off in the right really really right direction. Um for this second part of the conversation we're going to move from those you know the global pathways what we've seen around um the world and

really understand what is happening on the ground and how our leaders really making these tradeoffs and choices um on some of the very practical considerations that has been brought up

by um the previous uh two speakers. As we get ourselves settled uh right now um I'll just encourage those who are walking in we have room in the middle uh

please just come straight and in the middle there's there's quite some space great so we have been reminded that the future of AI is really it's not to be detered

determined by AI alone and by technology alone but really the choices about infrastructure data access compute um governance opportunity safeguards so these there are a lot of considerations

that need to be put in place and when it comes to the context of Africa going to be our focus of uh the next conversation the question is no longer about whether AI will shape Africa's future it will

and it already is um and the real question on hand is really how do We deliberately um use these tools and shape these conversations in a way that we are

designing the future um and looking at critical things in mind like who are building these foundations who sets the guard rails who determines how power is you know um how power and value is

distributed when we're using AI in these technologies. So for these next conversation, we are shifting from more of that vision to execution. And I'm delighted to welcome uh two fantastic

speakers um from uh Africa. First, we are really honored to have um honorable uh Paul Gabir from Rwanda um who is not only just leading the AI charge in Rwanda but is also really helping

support to shape uh the continental vision through the AI council which we will hear more about today. And secondly, we're privileged to be joined by director general lassina Kon of Smart

Africa who serves um as the which serves as the secretariat of the AI council. I'll just take this opportunity to welcome um Minister P uh Ingabir and Director General on the panel.

[applause] A round of applause for them. We might be joined by Minister Cena Lawson. Uh but because of just some travel uh

delays, he's just arriving today. So she might be lucky to catch us on stage, but if not um just wanted to convey that message, but we're going to have a fantastic

conversation. Um, nonetheless, &gt;&gt; well, [laughter] &gt;&gt; yeah, director general is happy to be sitting between uh between the minister

and I today. So I think as we start um I want to start with some of the ideas that have been brought about in the previous panel really looking at what I think came across as a diffusion

architecture uh infrastructure where for um AI to be adopted widely we need to have those critical foundations and open rails that allow for interoperability for trust um um trust models of data and

solutions and really without this foundational infrastructure um you know we see chances where we we we're having pilots but if we have these infra foundational architecture in place

then we really get systems um ministering I'd like to start with you um and just honing in uh from the Rwanda example so Rwanda is arguably I think across the continent quite ahead

in terms of the AI agenda and really setting the pace in many ways. um where have you found success and what remains hard um in this kind of you know diffusion infrastructure of balancing

the foundations and catching up with uh some of the um faster trends um when it comes to models of AI and data solutions. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much uh Diana and

pleasure to be speaking with Lassina. Um coming back to AI as a technology for Randa, it's not just a technology priority. It is also a governance priority. The conversation that we had

just before was talking about the diff diusion architecture infrastructure. And when I think about it, it's really those components that are going to allow us to move AI applications from pilots to

useful scale. Um and when you look at that, there are a couple of things. the rails that you mentioned, there's the compute infrastructure, there's data as infrastructure, there's skilling and uh

there's the regulations of of course which where we have to be thinking about uh ethical application of AI in different sectors and I know Sangu before he left on the panel he did

mention you know you know what's one word he could give some of the you know developing countries and really I think when you look at Africa as a whole we have an advant advantage of one uh the

demographics of our continent. It's similar for Randa, for Togo, for Sly one, everywhere. You have very young people. These are the people that are going to shape these AI solutions. It's

a huge consumer market. But I think there's also clarity on our side as policy makers that we need to be able to shift this demographic from being consumers but truly becoming active

players in producing this technology for the challenges that they face. The second advantage that we have for many countries lies in the fact that on one side we may benefit from the fact that

we don't have a lot of legacy systems which is what many countries grapple with the investments that they've made in uh infrastructure and systems as they've gone digital and this in a way

becomes a barrier to how quickly they can leaprog and I think we're looking at it as an advantage for us um as a continent now when you think about AI adoption In Africa, it's not a model

problem. It's a system problem. It's being able to look at what do we need? And for many countries, what you're going to send, I'll particularly speak for Randa's case when we put in place

our national AI and policy strategy. One of the things that we are looking at is how do we have centralized coordination as a government with decentralized execution. So, in a sense, what we're

looking at is to say we've set the policy agenda on AI. um what where does Rhonda benefit with AI and we've looked at it from an application and use case perspective where do we see the benefits

of AI uh supporting our society we're a proof of concept country and what that means is that we are willing to test try and scale things as fast as possible as we build all the other foundations which

is infrastructure and all to do that we're going to require to make sure data becomes a key point I mean if we still have a lot of our data that is in papers and books and stuff then I mean you

cannot train these models with that. We have the advantage for the last 15 to 20 years where we've been able to digitize a lot of our services and that means we have a lot of data that we can start

with cleaning it and making sure that it can be used uh to train many of these models and thanks to different partnerships we have uh a program that we are running with World Bank funding

to create a national data hub and that is going to be um a critical foundational piece or rail that is going to be key to how we do that. I'll end on one thing. I think where there's still

more work to be done is there's many of these models are trained on English. So, uh being able to accommodate them to our linguistic and cultural context is very important. And so as we forge multiple

partnerships across you know the world this is going to be a key uh factor in on what scale is going to look like so that we're not only creating just small solutions for Africa as opposed to

global solutions that serve you know uh global needs and two being able to scale this workforce this demographic demographic that we have as an advantage which is our young people most of them

70% of them below 30 being able to skill them and give them the tools tools that are needed uh for them to thrive in this AI economy. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much uh Minister Gabir and

I'd like just to follow up on one of the things that you said about Rwanda being a proof of concept country. I think on the continent we are really seeing that and there are many um you know very fast

um examples and uh pilots and uh models that are coming out of Randa that the continent is really looking at. But I think on this global stage and looking at um um you know being in India and

really I'm I'm I'm comparing Rwanda and India in this case because Rwanda India is more like the has become the proof of concept for the for the world in many ways you know from DPI and then how they

innovatively thinking about AI right now and I see the role that Ronda is kind of playing um on the continent but Africa is very complex. I think our diversity is also our strength in many ways and if

we start looking at how I think thinking about the continent as a unit is is very difficult and I'm sure uh DG has a lot to say about that as well in terms of scale in terms of size in terms of

maturity in terms of uh language as you said we have some individual countries with over 2,500 languages in just one country um so just looking at the scale of Rwanda being a relatively small

country um on the continent and some of the big ambitions that Rwanda is taking um on um AI in your experience does being small come uh relatively small because I know there are some uh much

smaller ones much much smaller ones so does being relatively small really does it create constraints or does it really allow for greater agility um just from your lessons of being a proof of concept

country I think that's something that Ronda might be best able to showcase on how to balance those two &gt;&gt; say I would say it's the latter uh it's being able to create that agility uh to

test things and move very fast uh we've always spoken of the example of zipline where we were the first country that was able to use drones to deliver blood and medical products uh to rural uh health

facilities where you know the road infrastructure wasn't there yet and maybe it was going to take days or hours to deliver some of these uh medical products And now it was literally taking

minutes. And so when you quantify that in terms of lives saved and all of that, but what is powerful about it is two things that came out of that uh proof of concept. One is that because we're able

to test with zipline, we're able to be a pioneer in creating what we called uh performance-based regulations for the drone industry. And many countries have been using this. And what it allows is

that for different drone operators that are going to different countries to um you know to launch some of their products, it's you you're able to look at what are the risks with each use case

but allow yourself to implement them. But two, what it did create for us was a booming uh drone ecosystem where we started to see many local startups because of that environment that had

been created with zipline benefiting uh from you know that shared uh you know ecosystem enablement that had been provided. Now when you look at AI it's a similar approach that we're really

taking. Um we've already earmarked a few uh use cases in healthcare, agriculture and education. for education. We're looking at how we can deploy AI for teachers to support them with grading

and assessments. So that helps uh with uh with with with how quickly they can you know support uh learning with the farmers and you'll see this across Africa. Majority of the countries have

uh majority of the population that are in the farming uh you know industry. So with farmers, we're already looking at an AI chatboard that helps them to access extension services that helps

them to access uh early warning systems and weather forecasts quickly and will allow them you know to increase some of their productivity. So if such becomes successful in Rwanda, scaling it

elsewhere won't be different because agriculture in you know Ghana or Togo or Nigeria or Kenya is not any different from agriculture in Rhonda. When it comes to healthcare because our last

mile frontline workers are community health workers and they're the ones delivering primary health care services to the communities. We're also equipping them uh with an AI decision support tool

that allows them to provide better diagnosis to the local communities, but it also reduces the backlog in the referral system. So if such a use case is successful, not only will it be

relevant in Africa, it will be relevant elsewhere in the world because everyone is trying to figure out how to ensure that we are delivering better health care and equitable health care for our

population. And so I think I'll end on on the note that for us being relatively small is not seen in as a barrier in any way. We are actually leveraging that as an opportunity to say we can scale

faster and create uh impact for the entire country and sort of show uh what is truly possible and and create blueprints for countries that want to follow suit.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Um we're looking forward to seeing most of these lessons actually going beyond Africa as well. uh because I think learning is is is two-way and as much as we have a lot to learn from the

you know real examples across the world I think there's a lot that Africa can also share uh beyond Africa as well uh director general from your vantage point at smart Africa and really looking at

this convergence of you know multiple countries within the secretariat um I think you you may you must be observing different countries ambition and starting points are different and um

you know the the purpose and motivations could be different. Uh we have some governments who are moving quickly on their AI strategy and deployment. Others are taking a a slower pace just building

on the foundational um digital systems that they need. I think it's just natural to see this um uh difference in others racing ahead and others being um um in trying to be you know the standard

bearers of technology. So for the smart Africa um uh secretariat and also through the council, where are you trying to encourage

countries to work collectively and in unison? And then where do you believe that there should be this healthy competition as well between countries? &gt;&gt; Thank you very much for inviting me,

sister. I'm honored also to be here with the minister Paula, council member of course uh uh in Rwanda based in Rwanda. Uh this is a very important questions

as the CEO of smart Africa where we sitting we see how country compete or countries are racing ahead uh to be uh standard bearer in the technology.

Before I actually answer this question, we tackle these questions. Uh we have to uh understand one fundamental things. Uh champions

uh are not created uh by ambitions only. I'm very glad and happy to have Rwanda here because uh although the minister Paula said it's a concept uh it's a it's it's a proof of

concept I I I would say it's a test bed as well and you will see the difference countries do not just becomes champions because of the ambitions no champions are created when when you see

an alignment between the political will and the deep understanding of the challenges of the country. You see when everywhere you travel around our world, the head of the state

or government, they all have a will. Political will, we have it. But do you understand the challenges because you will make a decision out of that will which may not be addressing

the real challenges. And you will see the example. Example of that is uh we've seen for the past 15 10 15 years a confusions between sectoral

digitalizations and systemic digitalization which is a transformations. Some country understood digitalizations to be we have to digitalize every

ministry minister by ministry agency by min by by agency but with no unique identification number in a way that is not citizencentric. You re-enter or you you you you basically enter your

information every single time you're facing the government. What happened? Yes, the ministry agencies they were digitalized but the government way of working has

not changed because there's no perception from the experience of the of the citizen he need to redo it every time but some other country like Rwanda for example

they understood the digitalization as government whole approach where you enter your information once and it's up to the government to basically circulate it secure it we use

it within itself in a way that you don't pay for birth certificate in Rwanda. No, if if you they require birth certificate, you just they know where to get it because they're the one who give

it to you. So the burden shift from citizen to the system. So they understood you see the two difference. So that's actually understanding the fundamental

bottlenecks of your national challenges. It helps you to lead or to be a champion or not to be a champion. Now let's come back to your questions where you said what do we do uh how do we encourage

where do we encourage our countries to cooperate where to encourage them to compete? The philosophy of of smart Africa is really let's cooperate

on the foundations and compete on performance and I will explain foundations today in the AI era when we look at it

when we see all these five to six pillars of uh AI from computing power data set we all talking about that the number one that comes into mind is infrastructure.

In the infrastructure today, how can Africa a continent represent 18% of the world uh world populations and we only control about 1.8% of uh large the data centers

and uh looking at the AI computing power infrastructure it is very capital intensive. Although no one single country only should do it alone. So on the infrastructure we must

work together. The second thing is the governance and the standard. We have today about 20 plus country in Africa who have already elaborated the

national AI strategy. one we have uh close to 35 country who have enacted uh data protection law and we have of course the African Union continental AI strategy in place today

when we look at the data governance we're looking at the things governance standard if there is no governance we have over 50 country in Africa fragmented market.

If we do not have a vehicle, if we don't have harmonization in terms of the governance, the startup will not scale. Number two, if we don't have a standard harmonized among ourselves, there will

be no interoperability. Then if we have also regulatory that are not uh flexible enough, it basically it makes the investment scarce. It means the opportunity for investor to come to

Africa it becomes difficult and that's one of the reason why if you look at these threes the Africa AI council was actually put in place and exist to be able to be a continental vehicle to look

at all of these harmonization across the governance and the standard so on the governance we must cooperate third things it's the AI scaling hub we have over 24 400 organizations in

Africa uh working on innovation as AI we AI market of course is projected to grow I believe the statistics show from 2025 to 2030 for 4.4 4 billion 4.5 billion to 16 billion by 2030.

But if you look at it today, we only control about 1% of the global AI investments. The challenges in Africa is not the lack of talent, it's lack of scale.

The lack of scale, it's very simple. If we don't scale, how do we want to be perceived by investors outside Africa? We should not be looking at Africa just through the windows of Kenya, 50

million. Through the windows of Ghana, 30 million, through windows of Rwanda, 14 million, we're looking at the 1.4 billion. In order to be looked at that way, we need to scale and we cannot

scale if we don't talk to each other. if there's not right coordination mechanism that's why that's why also the AI uh council exist. So I'm going to be wrapping up very quickly.

But in order to be able to to coordinate properly effectively, we need to look at the three things. The investment model these days.

The financial investments model or financial financing model today is too slow for the AI era. Government need to be doing its role in terms of setting the basis for regulatory

environment. Private sector need to be speeding uh speeding up uh the executions of different project. Philanthropist need to be derisking because AI is an animal that to be

honest with you no one actually know except maybe two big nation. So everyone's actually scared. So we need a kind of d we cannot be looking at the AI as a traditional way we're

looking at the uh infrastructure project. No we have to deliberately taking a risk to do it. So again in AI scaling we must cooperate. Now where do we have to compete?

&gt;&gt; Competition is good actually. We compete on performance. We compete on speed of implementation. We have a Rwanda very fastpace they've done zipline many other thing

quality of services of public services quality of service we've seen the startup nations two years ago I think uh Africa attracted about $5 billion in Africa in terms of uh

investment in the venture capitalist 50% were in Nigeria that's the competition so we must cooperate on the foundation on compete on the performance. Whichever country comes faster we b take that

country as a benchmark like we doing today for Rwanda formul we didn't need to go to Estonia to learn about they did exchange because already in Africa it has already started long time ago in

Rwanda. That's my take on that. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I'd like to check with um Honorable Ingabir. any quick reaction to that balance of uh competition and collective um progress first

particularly the um I'm thinking that those could be also be really good sources of metrics to measure like how are we moving on the collective and you know the governance areas and then what

are the metrics now for the performance-based um uh competition as you said but just any quick reactions to what um DG has mentioned &gt;&gt; thanks I I think fully agree and perhaps

what we want to sort of figure out is on the things that we must collaborate on &gt;&gt; how fast can they move because the the things if it's standardization for example we know um a lot of countries

are working uh on their AI policies and strategies many countries are starting to deploy their digital ID infrastructure if we want to standardize some of these things the faster we can

move in doing that the easier it will be to enable the competitive side of of you know the performance metrics that we all uh would subscribe to but also in a way I think it's also figuring out how do we

create and think through the AI council that has been created a repository and knowledge base of what's happening elsewhere because I think much as we would love to see competition happening

we also want to make sure no one on the continent is left behind so we want to be able to say what has worked how do you quickly scale it in other places like people don't have to rein reinvent

the wheel on solving the same problems. And so the competition should be on who can help us quickly understand what's the best way to implement something that is going to work for the continent and

the and the rest of us you know follow suit so that at least as a continent we can you know hold you know sort of accompany each other in this journey of you know figuring out all these nuances.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. You've both talked about the AI council. So I think maybe we can switch gears and uh in two minutes each really just understand um uh what the purpose is. Um at Dial we've

been privileged and lucky to really join uh smart Africa in the past. We've worked a lot around peer learning together and it's good to see the need and the urgency and opportunity for

learning also when it comes to AI because we've repeatedly seen that countries learn best from each other and that need for facilitated and structured learning is really important um so that

we also maintain the pace so that we're not learning forever and we're not uh there needs to be movement also on the collective things that we are moving together with so I'd like to just pose a

one question for each of you. Um from this learning perspective, we heard Nandan mention that we need to learn from each other. He gave examples of Ethiopia and India. You've both

mentioned the need to learn. Um maybe DJ, I'll start with you. Uh in just 2 minutes, could you tell us what a successful learning platform when you're talking about AI, what that could look

like and how you hope um others will participate um particularly on the with the foundation that the council is putting in place. Thank you very much. Uh to answer your

questions, it's very simple. What has started as a simple messaging system on the social media 15 20 years ago becames today a dependency. All of you here use some kind of social

media where the data is not actually hosted in India. Is that correct? Well, yes. it becomes so it started as a tool it becomes now a dependency let's not that happen with the AI

because with the AI is actually more dangerous because AI is biased one of the reason the council exists to bring that awareness first if you look at the thematics of course

when you launch the uh AI 15 country members uh members and we have five thematic groups group, five or six method group I believe compute uh algorithm

skill sets and uh we have a market and and the governance and so on and so forth and that's what minister Paul was saying let's agree on what is the governance really mean for Africa

because for us we're not looking as I always say we're not looking for the most powerful AI we're looking for the most useful AI we're not looking for AI girlfriend or boyfriend that's in the

pure language we're looking for AI in agriculture, AI in healthcare, AI in fintech, AI in education because that's where exactly be having more impact. So the most successful learning that we

really see I'm going to go very quickly. I think having that to having the council existing and having all these peer learning embedded within each thematic group where we can learn as I

said no one is leading except the two nation. We believe that the peer learning in any different sector or the pillars of AI will be the best platform to put together. Thank you

&gt;&gt; Minister Angabir. [applause] &gt;&gt; I think I would what I would add on what Lassa is saying is a couple of things and and I think it's the fear that most people have where there's an assumption

that you'll just deploy AI for the sake of deploying it. Um there are things that AI is great at solving for and there are things maybe it won't be the best to use.

&gt;&gt; Um so from a learning perspective, how do we consider learning successes? It's one being able to define problems that are actually best solved by AI. &gt;&gt; That way we all don't go with the hype

of implementing AI for the sake of implementing AI because then we won't be able to show the impact that we have. And the last one is being able to measure and communicate what the impact

is. How many lives are saved? How many doctor hours have been saved? How are we improving learning outcomes? How are we making sure that the agricultural productivity is increasing? If we can be

able to talk of impact from that perspective, then that will be the best of our learning successes. &gt;&gt; Perfect. I'll put you on the spot and ask you in one minute as we close when

we converge again and hopefully most of you will be here next year at the next AI summit. What is one thing that you would be able you would like to be able to report from the secretariat and from

the council perspective and then also from the Rwanda like a national perspective what would be one thing that you know from now to then good to come back and say we have done this I think

for us it's simply the three use cases we've mentioned being able to say this is what we tested this is the impact it's given us and this is how it's been growing and scaling in Ronda and outside

of Ronda I think we need to move beyond just talking about the ambitions or the ongoing work that is underway but truly being able to showcase the impact that

we've been able to generate. DG &gt;&gt; for me. I want to I would love to come back here and see at least one of our country members

deploy or started to deploy a sovereign AI because what I talked about what started as a messaging tool becomes a dependency for us AI it's so important we need to

be looking at at the angle of the sovereignty so sovereign AI &gt;&gt; with that I really like to thank you both for a fantastic conversation thank you for being a fantastic audience as

well. Um we hope to catch up and you know discuss in the rest of the session. Thank you very much for making it today. Thank you very much.
