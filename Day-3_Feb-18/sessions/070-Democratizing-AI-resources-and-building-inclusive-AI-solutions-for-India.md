## 📝 Transcript

itself has a quite relevance when we talk about democratizing AI. We do understand the whole summit when it talks about AI. The importance comes in how it reaches to the people or to the

unreached how we can have them uh the AI available to every one of us. So there are multiple aspects of it. It's just not technology. It's just not uh we will say it's a technical thing which needs

to be changed. It includes governance, capacity building, infrastructure, multiple things switching. So that's what the session is going to focus on. Uh whether we are talking about uh I

would say how to make the sustainable AI deployment, affordable, the cost of ownership, reach, bridging the skill gap. So we have a stellar panel which is there the people who have joined us

today and since it is the part of a global AI summit we do understand the value it carries in across India as well as globally in terms of people watching it. So we really look forward to a

intense discussions I would say with a kind of a panel across different stakeholder groups which has been framed up. So thank you Mahi G for joining us today. I would now request the

distinguished panel to kindly join me. We have with us uh additional secretary new emerging and strategic technologies divin ministry of external affairs government of India Mahavir Singhmiji Gi

sir can I request you to join us on the stage please and the panelist for the session would be Mr. Sepenna chief growth officer India MEA France IA Italy from the tech Mr. Sharat Bulusu senior

director Google play Google pay India Mr. Samir Fukan, director, head customer and partner engineering Intel India. Mr. Pravin Das, lead partnerships manager South Asia Wikipdia Foundation. Miss

Rajita Kulkarnney, President Shishi University. And the session is being moderated by Mr. Brad Staples, CEO of APCO. Can I have a round of applause for the panelist please? Thank you.

[applause] Can I request the so the people it's a permanent seating which has been there for the hall for everyone. I think the previous hall remanded this kind of a

seating. Can I request everyone to please move little forward so that it's easier for anybody who comes in a little later to be there. So please take the seats. I think front line would be

better. And also can I request the speakers I think that's a requirement from the organizer side to kindly have a group photograph first because it's a real-time photograph which is being

given as momentos after the session. So they would need the photograph first before we go ahead with the session. So can I request everyone to please step ahead and can we have a group photograph

please? So now we proceed with the session. Uh Mahi we would like to start off uh with your uh this thing special address. I have just mentioned that democrat while

you while you were walking inside the democratizing AI is just not about we just talk about technology it's much beyond whether you talk about governance capacity building or anything which is

more related to reaching to the unreached and India it's a specific example whether you talk about multilingual diversity or you talk about the the divide we would have between

rural and urban so far in terms of the reach while we talk about 900 million internet subscribers still lot needs to be done in terms of the availability and things being available. We know how UPI

has made a revolution for us which is being talked about a lot. We talk we probably say about 12 billion UPI transactions every month but there's still a long leap to taken.

Democratizing is empowering everyone, getting the AI affordable, available for everyone at every keeping in mind the the the situation of each and every country and India being talked about a

leader getting being uh being a leader for the global south, how we can work on that area, how we can develop that area, how India can also uh make the solutions and also export the solutions. So over

to you Mi for your special address. Uh &gt;&gt; sir, your comfort zone please. Uh thank you uh Fiki for inviting me to speak uh in this session on

democratization of AI. I think you have already mentioned a lot of things in your remarks. So maybe I'll uh be very brief on what I need to say and what I'm going to say. But yes, democratization

of AI is an extremely important subject uh given the context in which we are we have assembled here today. Uh when we talk about AI, I think it is very important that AI reaches to everyone.

So it is in fact a truly humbling uh uh I would say uh kind of experience for me to stand before such a distinguished panel uh and also uh the minds who are shaping the future of this country and

perhaps the future of the humanity and the world in the going in the times to come. So when we speak about artificial intelligence today, I think we often tend to speak in the language of scale,

disruption and the global geopolitical competition. Yet I would like to begin with a simpler question and that is and I invite all of you to also reflect on that uh with me that who is AI really

for? Is it for those who it is it for those with access to vast computing power and proprietary data sets or is it for the large corporations building frontier models or can AI

become a public resource something that empowers a farmer in Bundel Khan or a school teacher in Northeast or a small entrepreneur in Cooamur and a community health worker in

rural Rajasthan. So friends in my view if AI is to shape the future of the humanity then the answer must be very clear that it must work for everyone and that's what uh see

uh the you know the host from the fiki said in her remarks and this perhaps brings me to the core theme of today's uh session which is democratizing AI resources and building an inclusive AI

solutions for India. And before we explore how to do this, I think we need to pause and think and ask ourselves why is there such an urgency around democratizing AI?

And the answer is that to my understanding urgency exists because AI is fast becoming the new infrastructure of economic growth, governance and social

transformation. And just if you look at the history just as electricity powered the industrial age and the internet provided and powered the information age I think

the AI will power the intelligence and if access to this intelligent infrastructure remains concentrated in few hands inequalities will widen between nations between regions and

between citizens. So ladies and gentlemen, the real question before us is this. Do we want AI to amplify privileges or do we want it want it to

expand opportunities for all? And for a country like India, the answer is self-evident. Our development story has always been about scale with inclusion. We cannot

build AI an AI future that leaves behind our linguistic diversity, our small enterprises, our farmers, our informal workforce or as students in the government schools. And therefore to my

mind democratizing AI is not merely a technological choice. It is also a developmental imperative particularly for the global southern country like India.

So this now I think leads us to the next logical question. What does democratization of AI truly mean in practice? And to my mind as I say it means

affordable access to compute power and cloud infrastructure. It means open and representative data sets that reflect India's diversity. It also means tools and platforms that could perhaps be used

in the Indian languages. It also means skilling and reskilling our workforces. It means enabling startups, researchers and public institutions to innovate without prohibitive barriers. And most

importantly to my mind it means designing AI solutions that solve real societal challenges at scale. And friends in many ways India is uniquely positioned to

lead this effort and we are doing lot of things in this direction. We have already demonstrated how digital public infrastructure can democratize access. You all know about it.

You all know that how Aadhaar gave identity to over 1.4 billion people. UPI revolutionized digital payments and empowered small merchants. Co as you all know enabled the world's

largest vaccination drive. And these were not just merely technological platforms. They were instruments of inclusion. All of these empowered to some extent

inclusion at scale. And today's ladies and gentlemen, we are extending this philosophy into the AI era. How we are doing it? I think we are

doing it through AI mission. India AI mission as you all know. Through that the government is working to create shared AI compute infrastructure so that startups, academic institutions and

innovators are not logged out of the you know uh out of the AI revolution due to cost barriers. Also the creation of highquality anom anomized and consent based public data

set sets is being prioritized to enable innovations while safeguarding privacy. And we are also investing in in AI skilling initiative to prepare our youth for an AIdriven future ensuring that

talent is not limited to the elite institutions but emerges also from tier 2 and tier three cities as well. We have AI future skilling program. We have many other programs which the government is

undertaking. In this regard another important dimension is the language inclusion and that on that we have focused very much

As you all know we have hundreds of languages and dialects and if AI system do not understand our linguistic diversity I think they cannot serve our people.

So in that context, initiatives such as Basini are enabling speech and language technologies across Indian languages allowing citizens to interact with digital services in their mother tongue.

And friends, this is not merely about convenience. It is also about dignity, access and empowerment. At the same time, we are also witnessing AI being deployed to solve real

development challenges. How we are doing it? I think you all know precision agriculture tools. Uh they are helping farmers optimize water and fertilizer uses. AI assisted

diagnostics improving healthcare delivery in underserved regions. Adaptive learning platform nowadays are supporting personalized education and intelligent traffic management uh system

is improving the urban mobility and each of these examples reflects an important principle and that is AI must be built not only for efficiency but for equity and that is very important.

However, as we move forward, another critical dimension emerges and that is democratizing AI is not only about access. It is also about trust and this is very crucial.

People must trust that AI systems are fair, transparent and accountable. And in this context, India's approach emphasizes responsible AI as you all know which includes ensuring safety,

minimizing bias, protecting privacy and aligning innovations with democratic values. And in this context, our data protection framework,

emphasis on ethical AI and multistakeholder consultation reflect an approach that balances innovation with safeguards. And this now brings me to another

important question ladies and gentlemen and that is can India offer a model to the world and to my mind yes we can. Our approach as you all know combines open innovation with digital sovereignty. We

promote open ecosystems, interoperable platforms and global collaboration while ensuring that the national data security, privacy and strategic autonomy are preserved.

Many developing nations are facing similar challenges. How to harness AI without becoming dependent on external technological monopolies? This is a very crucial question before

them. In this context, I would say that India's experience in building a scalable, inclusive, digital public goods offers a replicable pathways forward.

But friends, let us also be candid with ourselves. Many challenges still remains and we must be cognizant of those challenges. Compute costs still remain very high.

High quality domain data sets are still limited. AI talent needs continuous upscaling. Startups require patient capital. Ethical governance framework must keep pace with technological

evolutions. And perhaps most importantly, we must guard against algorithm biases that can reinforce social in inequalities.

So the question therefore is not whether democratization is desirable. It is of course but the question more important is whether we can act with urgency and with collective purpose and

I think this is very very crucial. So friends uh this responsibility to my mind does not lie with government alone. I think industry must also invest in inclusive design and responsible de

deployment. Academia must expand interdisciplinary AI research rooted in societal needs. Startup must innovate for bhat not only for global markets. Civil society must ensure accountability

and ethical oversight and international partnerships must enable equitable access to AI resources and knowledge. So let me return ladies and gentlemen to the question which I posed in the

beginning. Who is AI for? And as I said if AI remains concentrated in few hands, it will deepen divides. If AI become accessible, inclusive and trusted, it can become the greatest

force multiplier for human progress. And here India has the opportunity to shape a new paradigm. one where AI is not an instrument of exclusion but a platform for empowerment not a luxury for the few

but a utility for the many and not merely intelligent but humane. So our task is not just to build smarter machines. It is also to build a smarter and fairer society.

And if we succeed in democratizing AI in making it accessible, inclusive and aligned with human dignity, then ladies and gentlemen, India will not only lead in the age of artificial intelligence,

it will define what a just AI future looks like. Thank you and I look forward to hearing the views of other panelists. Thank you very much. Thank you Mahabui G for setting the strategy direction as

well as mentioning about the India's AI journey so far and the way forward. Now we move on to the panel discussion over to you Brad. We have to give the room at 12:25. So I'll request you to continue

till 12:23 and I'll take only two minutes to give a vote of thanks at the last. So give it to you. Over to you Brad. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's go. Um we we'll use the time

as well as we possibly can. Um I'm Brad Staples. I'm the CEO of uh APCO. We're a global advisory group and it's an honor and a pleasure to be with you to be with the additional secretary in this

esteemed panel. Let let me go straight to the skills gap dimension here. There's no choice but to democratize in India. But a critical way of ensuring that the greater part of society

benefits from the AI revolution that we're all witness to is to put in place the skills development bridge that skills gap. So I'd like to go to Rajita Gulkani from Shri University and Rajita

I mean building the a future ready skill set in line with skill India's mission of social empowerment uh it's not an easy task can you tell us a little bit about what Shishu University is doing in

this regard where your focus is and what your ambition and expectation is &gt;&gt; yes thank you thank you Brad and uh thank you to Mahabir G for those uh very uh valuable contextual remarks, context

setting remarks. Uh so Brad in um response to what you were mentioning in Trisha University uh we have two advantages. One we owe our parentage to the international art of living

foundation which is uh present today in 184 countries of the world. So with that the internationality of uh context comes to us with the you know wi with the nationality and the local context as

well. And secondly uh our founder Puja Guruv Shishi Ravi Shankharji uh because of his international and spiritual stature we bring what what we get is even the underlying and foundational

values that go above and beyond AI. So few things that uh we are attempting to do which I think are showing results and will show more results in the years to come. Number one is uh comprehensive AI

education. So we have uh engineering and technology um faculty which is only an emerging in emerging sciences and emerging technologies faculty. We have about 24 programs which are all for

emerging tech AI, ML, cyber security, data science and so on. And with the NDP that enables us to make all these programs industry integrated. So we have some great partnerships in fact with

Intel with IBM with uh uh Verics with many other AI organizations for these programs. Secondly, we believe in AI for all. So the partnership I mentioned with Intel, they have in fact a foundational

program which is a AI for all program and that brand we are offering to all disciplines. So whether it's agriculture, ayurvea, yoga, psychology, management, architecture, all of them

have access to a foundational AI program. So that I mean I can talk more but in the interest of time. Thirdly, research and innovation. Uh we have a number of centers of excellence which

are focused on AI. An interesting one to note here is a center of digital humanism. uh I'm told it's one of the first of its kind in India and the world which to promote the idea that tech

including AI uh should be developed and applied with human needs at the core of it. So that is something which we are trying to push the frontiers of. And the second is our partnership with the

institute of absolute intelligence which is the foundation for artificial intelligence. Also our incubators are focusing on AI based startups. We have 180 startups one with the department of

science and technology government of India. So promoting AI based startups in our incubation. And lastly tools and platforms for inclusive. One of the topics of our discussion and we were

talking before is how to make it inclusive. So if AI has to be democratized, it has to reach tier 2, tier three, tier four cities, it has to reach rural entrepreneurs, it has to

reach women and that is our effort through our various ground level initiatives to see how we can uh reach this knowledge to all these sections of society. And uh the this is just some

few initial remarks and I can come back later uh in the conversation. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Thank you Rajita. Um Sundep let me come to you if I can. I mean critical to the success of the

deployment of AI across the country and across the economy is reaching those small and medium-sized businesses in a cost with cost-effective technology that can be deployed rapidly and and and

effectively. From your perspective, what are the strategies that are needed to ensure AI solutions are reaching those that are um operating at that level, that they're both cost-effective and

that they're part of this journey. And we were talking a little bit before about data sets and getting access to the right data sets. This is all part of securing India's future um sort of data

sovereignty and AI sovereignty. Talk a little about all of that if you wouldn't mind. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. So my name is Sepena. I'm the chief growth officer for ACLT

Tech. Uh based in London for the last 23 years, moving to Mumbai in April to you know accelerate our BART journey. Uh so thank you for inviting me. Uh I think uh and thank you for your kind words sir.

Uh I think the objective when we look just take a step back uh and we look at the larger perspective AI is what I call as people, purpose and planet. So when you talk about people I think we heard

some red words about it's not just about skills it's also about how do we deliver citizen services right how do we how do we the whole mankind the whole humanity benefits that's what I call people

purpose is about growth how do we deliver vikit bharat mission which includes overall growth which includes not just large enterprises a common man anybody who works enterprise whatever

that's what I call as purpose and of course the planet where we all live in. So I mean democratizing of AI today if you ask me AI is at a juncture where every organization every country is

thinking is thinking about taking a step back. People are taking small baby steps here and there trying to think how do I use it for the goals that I talked about. I mean governments are thinking

people, enterprises are thinking growth and everybody obviously planet comes in the middle. I think the one of the biggest thing that will happen in the coming months if not weeks is what we

call as uh delivering and making what I call as AI strategy. uh when I call AI strategy is uh everything because the the moment you start adopting AI at a large scale uh

you have to look at things like governance. How do you secure? What are the data sets? How is the data secure? How do you govern it? How will you make it more responsible? Once you make all

these frameworks put together, then you can thus deliver AI for masses because you have everything that needs to be built in the foundation itself. I think where AI will benefit immensely

in our context of our country which is so large unique uh and unique in a way because it's so diverse both culturally as well as the the economic uh straightup of our population.

Two things will be very important. One is how do we either build or if not built how do we train those models to India specific data sets. Today most of the large LLMs are trained for western

data. So the first thing will be training those LLMs to India context whether it is language whether any answer that you want to get any inferencing that you want to get. The

first thing is training for India data sets and the second is the data itself. Today everybody has tons and tons and tons of data everywhere. But the problem is how you know what is

the quality of that data and data is the biggest currency when you talk about the AI world. So imagine if I were to give you a very simple example which I gave and I'm going to be

short. You train a child. When a child is born, you train a child and we all train a child with you know the language English whatever the

language is. Slowly slowly you train the child and after a few times the child starts to learn the language. Somebody will write a poem and then that's how the whole journey starts. Imagine you

train a child with a foul language. It will be the most drastic thing that can happen to us which we have to be very very careful because if AI is trained with a wrong set of data trust

me the outcome you will not be able it will be so realistic the outcome will be so realistic you will not be able to say this is wrong because that's the power of technology. So to me in terms of

democratizing data is the biggest the local context when I say local context it covers everything it covers cost which covers affordability it covers the Indian

context whether it is language culture and then the sanity of data we have to get these two things right that's where the power of AI India led the digital revolution right I am pretty confident

India will lead the AI revolution, we just do things differently and that's what we continue to do. So, thank you very much and pass it back to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. Um I I'd

like to build on a couple of things you you were just saying there. Um this this access to the right data sets, being able to um build those highquality data sets is crucial to to the goal of

inclusivity and to democratize AI across the country. One person who is in the thick of doing that and grappling with it is on my right and that's Share Bulusu from um Google Pay. Um Sherice,

maybe you could just say a little bit about how you're grappling with this challenge, how you're looking at voice interfaces, vernacular languages, all of these nuances and critical elements to

secure an inclusive AI future for India and how that translates then into bridging the digital divide, creating the payment infrastructure that um will ensure that we bring all parts of the

country in in into this conversation. and maybe say a word or two about how AI solves for the challenges that it creates which we were talking about before which was very interesting.

Thanks Brad and thanks uh the organizers for uh having me here. Um I think I think of this problem as uh you know a little bit like the tale of two cities says uh it's the best of times it's the

worst of times. I think there's a way to look at this as uh this is a time of fear and it's also a time of hope. So the fear is uh that people will be left behind. Uh when UPI came along uh one of

the challenges that people thought that we would face is a person without a smartphone is going to be left behind. And that is true if the number of smartphones and the amount of

connectivity in the country stays static. What has actually happened is that's kept growing. I mean, I'm old enough to remember a time when the way we got any kind of important news in the

family was a phone call to a friend because that was the only person who actually had a working phone line in the neighborhood who would then relay that information to us to a point where

these are only two of the many phones that I carry with me. All of which are connected to the internet, all of which have all sorts of cellular connectivity. So I and that's the reason why I think

it's a time of hope because I think if we approach the problem from a point of optimism there are a number of problems that we can solve in very interesting ways. Uh let's take the question of

financial inclusion which uh Brad was asking about. Um I think one of the big challenges that we face particularly in India I think this is a global challenge but it has a lot of specific dimensions

that are crucial for India to get right is keeping people safe when it comes to how they use money online. It's easy to fall prey to social engineering. It is easy to fall prey to hacks. And the best

defense we have against it is to deploy better AI solutions that detect what's happening. Uh one of the beautiful things about the work that we've been doing in this space is just in UPI in a

year with AI powered warnings for people we are able to prevent about 13,000 crores worth of fraud annually. That's about a billion and a half dollars. Now it seems like a large amount but when

you consider that UPI moves more than4 trillion dollars a year that is a small drop in the ocean but for that one individual who's exposed to the scam even if it's 500 rupees that is a very

significant amount so I think deploying AI in a way that helps every single one of the people uh to stay safe with respect to money is something that's already happening so I see that as a

positive force that solves the problems that you know you could imagine uh would be created by social engineering. The second thing is we were talking briefly about credit uh and I know when um

Rajitha was uh talking to us in the lounge before we walked in she was talking about access to capital as one of the challenges for young entrepreneurs. Um,

one of the most beautiful things that I've had the privilege and honor of witnessing, being part of is people being able to use the digital financial trail that they leave behind when they

use uh protocols like UPI to get access to credit. Now, this requires building completely new models, models that can detect signals about creditworthiness, about the ability and willingness to

repay, etc. from a data source that is not what traditionally credit models were based on. Traditional credit models were based on a very different setup. The fact that we're able to bring AI and

machine learning to these types of problems and give people access to credit, help them build a new future is what makes me hopeful that when we build AI, we'll build it for everyone to be

included. And the last thing I'd say is ultimately like with all technology, this is going to depend on what we as the human beings at the center of it do. Um, you could

use engines and wheels to build a weapon of destruction. You could use it to build mass transit. You could use telecommunications to transmit uh information that is fake, information

that is harmful. You could also use it to stay in touch with your grandma. You could also use it to communicate educational information. The things that we if you look at this from a point of

fear, my worry is that we'll always worry about adoption. We'll think about how to put guard rails around it and block it. But I think if we approach it from a point of optimism, we'll build it

saying, "Hey, there's someone who needs help." The beauty of AI is that it can deliver it in any language, any modality, any time of the day. I mean, we're already seeing this with small

merchants. We're able to tell them, "Oh, you're in Nagaland. We I may not have a person on the ground there, but you know what? 24/7, 365, talk to this little software agent that

will solve any problem you have about digital payments." And you could apply this to health. You could apply this to a number of different areas. So, I think language is one of the areas where I'm

very proud of the work that the AI community at large has done. there are languages that would otherwise go extinct that we are able to protect through translation through creating and

generating corpuses. Uh so I think there's a lot of beautiful work that can happen here and that's why when I go back and say that you know it's an age of fear and it's an age of hope I think

we index much more heavily on the age of hope and that is what helps us build inclusive AI and democratize it for everyone. Thank you, Sheriff. That you're clearly

an AI evangelist and um giving us a positive optimistic vision of the future. So, thank you for that. I think we're all carried along for a moment with it. Um let's try to take continue

this idea of leaving nobody behind. Beyond payment systems and access to credit and those critical things, there are many other communities and dimensions in terms of this country's

economy and society that need to be pulled in if we're to secure a strong AI future. Let me turn to uh Intel to get uh Somo Fukan's um perspective on this. Let let me just ask you a little bit um

Shom if I can in terms of um reaching across India to leave nobody behind we have to have access to AI computing for uh tier one uh tier 2 tier three cities to uh small and medium-sized businesses

to academia to startups. How do we create that resilient ecosystem? I know that's what you're focused on. &gt;&gt; I consider the technology that cost

very focused on problem solver. So when you address this rightapility, affordability compens

increase efficiency that's a little bit weize

all platforms. He said any classroom should be able to access the best enter. question. Do you really need a highend

access? Probably not. A lot of times this capability can just be addressed by clients or PCs that most of the customers are.

So we believe that you have this conversation of democratizing AI different levels of platform starting from the component right

at the system level you start talking about computabilities the second piece that you want access to be working on is a function of connectivity right because on one side you can say

hey comput is great but I can't access it a lot of latency so as Intel we're also working on connectivity technologies like photonix right or computer express to Make sure we get the

experience that we visualize or ask at the classroom at the student that I just mentioned. That's number two. Right? The third thing again again I know the panels referred to is about you know

privacy sovereignity what have you. Right? Now when you look at an application workload level above the system right you don't need every data or every um uh query or every

instruction to come back to the data center. A lot of time the best way we can help the citizens is by making sure that they have control of their own data. So a lot of time you'll see that

actually a lot of stuff can be done closer to the user. There are a lot of concepts coming up around you know hybrid LLMs right where you do the inferencing and a partial part of the

training next to the user and then only for references you come back. Intel as a partner is work with most of the ecosystem partners going for that to be able to go and make sure that this

concept of getting the LLM or getting the training getting the inferencing close to the user is what you're focused on. So manufacturing level system level which is technology workload level which

I just talked about the LLM and last but not the least skilling that uh you know M Rajita already talked about. We are very focused on the skilling part because we believe that the farthest

distance people will be able to use it only when they're trained and I think uh hopefully some of you know we took a pi pledge for 100,000 um AI trained users during this uh summit itself and I think

we have raised that number. So uh I would also request all of you if you have not taken it please take the pledge because we believe that getting us up from a skilling perspective is crucial

for us to go back to our mission of democratizing and making it accessible to the citizen scales usage that India can provide. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Thank you S very much for

that and that vision of all classrooms across this country having access to the same lectures simultaneously the same quality of education and insights that really is a wonderful vision. We saved

the best till last obviously. So let me turn now to Pravin Das from Wikimedia Foundation. Um and let's talk a little bit about that knowledge ecosystem if we can and how we get to a place where open

knowledge ecosystems build AI literacy uh in a way that helps local languages the very many local languages and dialects across this country uh develop and be secure in this AI future. So

provid &gt;&gt; I think that's an interesting question. Um we are living in a country uh where it's a country within country there are multiple languages and um uh you know we

have most the oral scripts and and uh when it comes to the indic languages and the data set training models the large language models which is currently trained on is is mostly on the English

language and uh the SLMs are now marketing you know pretty much uh you know I mean there's a research is currently going on and at this point there is lot

of data set models which is being used to train these but the data sets which is uh there in these indic languages are less than even 1%. So in this time where there is less data

sets but at the same time we wanted to build a AI solution we really need to rely on plat open platforms like for an example Wikipedia it's a communitydriven model where the content is being created

by the community verified by the community for the community u and I believe u you know with the policy around content creation. It ensures that the data which comes in has

verified uh you know sources to it [snorts] and um with these verified sources we are able to build the data sets which can be trusted to train uh the models.

Now I think we have come really far from a problem where um uh you know which I had faced where um you know my parents used to think my finger is bigger than the keyboard and now can I ask anything

to AI? So there is lot which needs to be done at the ground level uh to make sure that these information pass on to the um you know audiences or the end users to not just use AI but also be the uh you

know contributor of the uh data sets as well. I I remember um uh you know like there are multiple initiatives for an example future of comments we were talking about

it how can we focus on um a common data set which is which can be trustworthy how can we align mostly with the educational institution um right students are the future can we embibe

sense of voluntism in terms of not just donating funds but can we talk about knowledge donations. All right. And um also I would like to specifically talk about um you know we

at the foundation end we did some couple of interventions like we created chat GPD plug-in just to ensure that um while people use this AI model they get a a content from a trustworthy source and um

we are also working with industries Um and we you know like Google in terms of building not just data corpus or filling the content gap in indic languages but also to expand the set of

communities who could contribute these data. Um also at the same time we were talking we are in a space where um we are saying you know computing we are focusing more

on computing and building indic language model but I think it is a high time for us to focus on um data commons for critically low language resource um uh resources language sorry low resource

languages. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Thank you Pavine. Uh thank you all um for your contributions. Thank you additional secretary for your remarks and for sharing the government's

vision and ambition for an AIdriven India and thank you all for your leadership in your different domains. I'll hand back. &gt;&gt; Thank you Brad. So that was actually a

good uh involving session I would say not many things the perspectives coming in whether we talked about being optimistic looking on the brighter side uh which was started in with the

resource languages whether we talking about low resource languages or the content being available in highly in English but we're talking about SLMs and the data that needs to be worked out and

with of course talking about how we are looking at India leading a AI revolution And then of course uh the Intel covering [bell] it up uh then Intel of course covering it up with respect to the

vision of having the similar lectures being available in the similar quality across all schools at the time and of course ma'am your vision which is much beyond AI. Uh so that was good to hear

and um Brad I'd like to ask something from you I know it's just last five minutes rather three minutes. So um like with your global perspective like which you coming from like while the

discussions here were more about democratizing AI in India u and you look into the role at a global person and you see it across geographies what is your view with respect to this subject and

I'm not limiting ourselves to our India discussion and anything which you feel from the globally which is really good or vice versa even from India. Yeah, I I I think um it's very interesting sitting

here having the conversation in India because many of the topics we've just spoken about we could be talking about in any part of the the the globe. I think there are real fears and concerns

that um AI will disagregate, divide and uh and just aggravate the wealth gap that we already have. Um I'm quite um captured by something that Sharath said about AI resolving the problems that

that are being created by this transition in this moment. And I actually think that's genuinely true. I think there's a there's a global conversation about a US hyperscala model

being imposed across the globe and that being in contradiction with the interests of emerging nations and the well-being of of populations and and somewhere at odds with inclusive growth.

I don't believe that's the case. I think with an intelligent framework that the government puts in place here and with um the full participation and engagement of real insight and knowhow built uh in

the US or in other parts of the world we will get to a better better outcome for everybody. So I think there's a win-win here. It does create strongly it requires strong leadership from

government. It can't be a regulation first model though. If we do that, we'll undermine the the the technology delivering the outcomes that we that that we want. Um, and in other parts of

the world, uh, certainly if you look at it from a European perspective, it's regulation first. And I can't see how we get the innovation, the creativity and just the, uh, the advancements that

we need. So I think it's very interesting to sit here and have this conversation. I think there's a lot of global insights from India. Yeah. So I take it like we take it more

for depth and impact which comes from India and the scale which of course our country gets into this. With this note we end the panel discussion. Thank you Mahavi G for sparing time and joining us

today. It was really nice to hear of course the strategy direction the role which Emmy and especially your revision is being playing when we talk about the frontier technology. So it was very

enlightening and thank you panelists for being so supportive. It was nice. I enjoyed it. I'm sure the people here present as well as on the online because we need to thank the audience across

there is live being telecasted. So thank you all for joining us today. I think the momentos are ready then maybe we can present it to the speakers right now. Uh is the momentos ready and can I request

my colleague love? We just have a minute. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So thank you all and with this we present the momentos from the organizer side. I think it's a real time photograph which

has been taken. Love, can I have you here so that we can just distribute the momentos for the group photograph? Yeah, we'll come back. I think there's a need for one more

group photograph. We'll step ahead. A big round of applause everyone for a wonderful session. May I request ma'am to give the moment to Mahav sir. Next I would request to give it to Brad.
